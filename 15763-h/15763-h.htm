<h2>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; CRIMSON FAVOURS.</h2>
<p>M. de Tavannes smiled.&nbsp; Mademoiselle averted her eyes, and shivered;
as if the air, even of that close summer night, entering by the door
at her elbow, chilled her.&nbsp; And then came a welcome interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal rose slowly.&nbsp; The King had called, and he had
no choice but to obey and go.&nbsp; Yet he hung a last moment over his
companion, his hateful breath stirring her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our pleasure is cut short too soon, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he
said, in the tone, and with the look, she loathed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
for a few hours only.&nbsp; We shall meet to-morrow.&nbsp; Or, it may
be&mdash;earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, and &ldquo;Tavannes!&rdquo; the King repeated
with violence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tavannes!&nbsp; Mordieu!&rdquo; his Majesty
continued, looking round furiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will no one fetch him?&nbsp;
Sacr&eacute; nom, am I King, or a dog of a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come, sire!&rdquo; the Count cried hastily.&nbsp; For Charles,
King of France, Ninth of the name, was none of the most patient; and
scarce another in the Court would have ventured to keep him waiting
so long.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come, sire; I come!&rdquo; Tavannes repeated,
as he moved from Mademoiselle&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>He shouldered his way through the circle of courtiers, who barred
the road to the presence, and in part hid her from observation.&nbsp;
He pushed past the table at which Charles and the Comte de Rochefoucauld
had been playing primero, and at which the latter still sat, trifling
idly with the cards.&nbsp; Three more paces, and he reached the King,
who stood in the <i>ruelle</i> with Rambouillet and the Italian Marshal.&nbsp;
It was the latter who, a moment before, had summoned his Majesty from
his game.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, watching him go, saw so much; so much, and the King&rsquo;s
roving eyes and haggard face, and the four figures, posed apart in the
fuller light of the upper half of the Chamber.&nbsp; Then the circle
of courtiers came together before her, and she sat back on her stool.&nbsp;
A fluttering, long-drawn sigh escaped her.&nbsp; Now, if she could slip
out and make her escape!&nbsp; Now&mdash;she looked round.&nbsp; She
was not far from the door; to withdraw seemed easy.&nbsp; But a staring,
whispering knot of gentlemen and pages blocked the way; and the girl,
ignorant of the etiquette of the Court, and with no more than a week&rsquo;s
experience of Paris, had not the courage to rise and pass alone through
the group.</p>
<p>She had come to the Louvre this Saturday evening under the wing of
Madame d&rsquo;Yverne, her <i>fianc&eacute;&rsquo;s</i> cousin.&nbsp;
By ill-hap Madame had been summoned to the Princess Dowager&rsquo;s
closet, and perforce had left her.&nbsp; Still, Mademoiselle had her
betrothed, and in his charge had sat herself down to wait, nothing loth,
in the great gallery, where all was bustle and gaiety and entertainment.&nbsp;
For this, the seventh day of the f&ecirc;tes, held to celebrate the
marriage of the King of Navarre and Charles&rsquo;s sister&mdash;a marriage
which was to reconcile the two factions of the Huguenots and the Catholics,
so long at war&mdash;saw the Louvre as gay, as full, and as lively as
the first of the f&ecirc;te days had found it; and in the humours of
the throng, in the ceaseless passage of masks and maids of honour, guards
and bishops, Swiss in the black, white, and green of Anjou, and Huguenot
nobles in more sombre habits, the country-bred girl had found recreation
and to spare.&nbsp; Until gradually the evening had worn away and she
had begun to feel nervous; and M. de Tignonville, her betrothed, placing
her in the embrasure of a window, had gone to seek Madame.</p>
<p>She had waited for a time without much misgiving; expecting each
moment to see him return.&nbsp; He would be back before she could count
a hundred; he would be back before she could number the leagues that
separated her from her beloved province, and the home by the Biscay
Sea, to which even in that brilliant scene her thoughts turned fondly.&nbsp;
But the minutes had passed, and passed, and he had not returned.&nbsp;
Worse, in his place Tavannes&mdash;not the Marshal, but his brother,
Count Hannibal&mdash;had found her; he, whose odious court, at once
a menace and an insult, had subtly enveloped her for a week past.&nbsp;
He had sat down beside her, he had taken possession of her, and, profiting
by her inexperience, had played on her fears and smiled at her dislike.&nbsp;
Finally, whether she would or no, he had swept her with him into the
Chamber.&nbsp; The rest had been an obsession, a nightmare, from which
only the King&rsquo;s voice summoning Tavannes to his side had relieved
her.</p>
<p>Her aim now was to escape before he returned, and before another,
seeing her alone, adopted his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> and was rude to her.&nbsp;
Already the courtiers about her were beginning to stare, the pages to
turn and titter and whisper.&nbsp; Direct her gaze as she might, she
met some eye watching her, some couple enjoying her confusion.&nbsp;
To make matters worse, she presently discovered that she was the only
woman in the Chamber; and she conceived the notion that she had no right
to be there at that hour.&nbsp; At the thought her cheeks burned, her
eyes dropped; the room seemed to buzz with her name, with gross words
and jests, and gibes at her expense.</p>
<p>At last, when the situation had grown nearly unbearable, the group
before the door parted, and Tignonville appeared.&nbsp; The girl rose
with a cry of relief, and he came to her.&nbsp; The courtiers glanced
at the two and smiled.</p>
<p>He did not conceal his astonishment at finding her there.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,
Mademoiselle, how is this?&rdquo; he asked, in a low voice.&nbsp; He
was as conscious of the attention they attracted as she was, and as
uncertain on the point of her right to be there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left
you in the gallery.&nbsp; I came back, missed you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped him by a gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not here!&rdquo; she muttered,
with suppressed impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell you outside.&nbsp;
Take me&mdash;take me out, if you please, Monsieur, at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was as glad to be gone as she was to go.&nbsp; The group by the
doorway parted; she passed through it, he followed.&nbsp; In a moment
the two stood in the great gallery, above the Salle des Caryatides.&nbsp;
The crowd which had paraded here an hour before was gone, and the vast
echoing apartment, used at that date as a guard-room, was well-nigh
empty.&nbsp; Only at rare intervals, in the embrasure of a window or
the recess of a door, a couple talked softly.&nbsp; At the farther end,
near the head of the staircase which led to the hall below, and the
courtyard, a group of armed Swiss lounged on guard.&nbsp; Mademoiselle
shot a keen glance up and down, then she turned to her lover, her face
hot with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you leave me?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did
you leave me, if you could not come back at once?&nbsp; Do you understand,
sir,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;that it was at your instance I came
to Paris, that I came to this Court, and that I look to you for protection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think Carlat and his wife fit guardians for me?&nbsp;
Should I have come or thought of coming to this wedding, but for your
promise, and Madame your cousin&rsquo;s?&nbsp; If I had not deemed myself
almost your wife,&rdquo; she continued warmly, &ldquo;and secure of
your protection, should I have come within a hundred miles of this dreadful
city?&nbsp; To which, had I my will, none of our people should have
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreadful?&nbsp; Pardieu, not so dreadful,&rdquo; he answered,
smiling, and striving to give the dispute a playful turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have seen more in a week than you would have seen at Vrillac in a lifetime,
Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I choke!&rdquo; she retorted; &ldquo;I choke!&nbsp; Do
you not see how they look at us, at us Huguenots, in the street?&nbsp;
How they, who live here, point at us and curse us?&nbsp; How the very
dogs scent us out and snarl at our heels, and the babes cross themselves
when we go by?&nbsp; Can you see the Place des Gastines and not think
what stood there?&nbsp; Can you pass the Gr&egrave;ve at night and not
fill the air above the river with screams and wailings and horrible
cries&mdash;the cries of our people murdered on that spot?&rdquo;&nbsp;
She paused for breath, recovered herself a little, and in a lower tone,
&ldquo;For me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think of Philippa de Luns by
day and by night!&nbsp; The eaves are a threat to me; the tiles would
fall on us had they their will; the houses nod to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he asked, shrugging his shoulders
and assuming a tone of cynicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To crush us!&nbsp; Yes, Monsieur, to crush us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all this because I left you for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For an hour&mdash;or well-nigh an hour,&rdquo; she answered
more soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I could not help it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have thought of that&mdash;before you brought me
to Paris, Monsieur.&nbsp; In these troublous times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He coloured warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are unjust, Mademoiselle,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are things you forget; in a Court one is
not always master of one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she answered dryly, thinking of that through
which she had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not know what happened!&rdquo; he returned with
impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not understand that I am not to blame.&nbsp;
Madame d&rsquo;Yverne, when I reached the Princess Dowager&rsquo;s closet,
had left to go to the Queen of Navarre.&nbsp; I hurried after her, and
found a score of gentlemen in the King of Navarre&rsquo;s chamber.&nbsp;
They were holding a council, and they begged, nay, they compelled me
to remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was that which detained you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not&mdash;Madame St. Lo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s face turned scarlet.&nbsp; The thrust in
tierce was unexpected.&nbsp; This, then, was the key to Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
spirt of temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were you in the King of Navarre&rsquo;s chamber,
and how long with Madame St. Lo?&rdquo; she asked with fine irony.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or no, I will not tempt you,&rdquo; she went on quickly, seeing
him hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard you talking to Madame St. Lo in the
gallery while I sat within.&nbsp; And I know how long you were with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Madame as I returned,&rdquo; he stammered, his face
still hot, &ldquo;and I asked her where you were.&nbsp; I did not know,
Mademoiselle, that I was not to speak to ladies of my acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was alone, and I was waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not know that&mdash;for certain,&rdquo; he answered,
making the best of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were not where I left you.&nbsp;
I thought, I confess&mdash;that you had gone.&nbsp; That you had gone
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whom?&nbsp; With whom?&rdquo; she repeated pitilessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Was it likely?&nbsp; With whom was I to go?&nbsp; And yet it
is true, I might have gone home had I pleased&mdash;with M. de Tavannes!&nbsp;
Yes,&rdquo; she continued, in a tone of keen reproach, and with the
blood mounting to her forehead, &ldquo;it is to that, Monsieur, you
expose me!&nbsp; To be pursued, molested, harassed by a man whose look
terrifies me, and whose touch I&mdash;I detest!&nbsp; To be addressed
wherever I go by a man whose every word proves that he thinks me game
for the hunter, and you a thing he may neglect.&nbsp; You are a man
and you do not know, you cannot know what I suffer! What I have suffered
this week past whenever you have left my side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville looked gloomy.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has he said to you?&rdquo;
he asked, between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can tell you,&rdquo; she answered, with a shudder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was he who took me into the Chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until he bids you do something,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His manner, his smile, his tone, all frighten me.&nbsp; And to-night,
in all these there was a something worse, a hundred times worse than
when I saw him last&mdash;on Thursday!&nbsp; He seemed to&mdash;to gloat
on me,&rdquo; the girl stammered, with a flush of shame, &ldquo;as if
I were his!&nbsp; Oh, Monsieur, I wish we had not left our Poitou!&nbsp;
Shall we ever see Vrillac again, and the fishers&rsquo; huts about the
port, and the sea beating blue against the long brown causeway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had listened darkly, almost sullenly; but at this, seeing the
tears gather in her eyes, he forced a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you are as bad as M. de Rosny and the Vidame!&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they are as full of fears as an egg is of
meat!&nbsp; Since the Admiral was wounded by that scoundrel on Friday,
they think all Paris is in a league against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; she asked, her cheek grown pale, her eyes
reading his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; Why, because it is a monstrous thing even to
think of!&rdquo; Tignonville answered, with the confidence of one who
did not use the argument for the first time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could they
insult the King more deeply than by such a suspicion?&nbsp; A Borgia
may kill his guests, but it was never a practice of the Kings of France!&nbsp;
Pardieu, I have no patience with them!&nbsp; They may lodge where they
please, across the river, or without the walls if they choose, the Rue
de l&rsquo;Arbre Sec is good enough for me, and the King&rsquo;s name
sufficient surety!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are not apt to be fearful,&rdquo; she answered,
smiling; and she looked at him with a woman&rsquo;s pride in her lover.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All the same, you will not desert me again, sir, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He vowed he would not, kissed her hand, looked into her eyes; then
melting to her, stammering, blundering, he named Madame St. Lo.&nbsp;
She stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need,&rdquo; she said, answering his look with
kind eyes, and refusing to hear his protestations.&nbsp; &ldquo;In a
fortnight will you not be my husband?&nbsp; How should I distrust you?&nbsp;
It was only that while she talked, I waited&mdash;I waited; and&mdash;and
that Madame St. Lo is Count Hannibal&rsquo;s cousin.&nbsp; For a moment
I was mad enough to dream that she held you on purpose.&nbsp; You do
not think it was so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She!&rdquo; he cried sharply; and he winced, as if the thought
hurt him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Absurd!&nbsp; The truth is, Mademoiselle,&rdquo;
he continued with a little heat, &ldquo;you are like so many of our
people!&nbsp; You think a Catholic capable of the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have long thought so at Vrillac,&rdquo; she answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s over now, if people would only understand.&nbsp;
This wedding has put an end to all that.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m harking
back,&rdquo; he continued awkwardly; and he stopped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead,
let me take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please.&nbsp; Carlat and the servants should be below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her left hand in his right after the wont of the day, and
with his other hand touching his sword-hilt, he led her down the staircase,
that by a single turn reached the courtyard of the palace.&nbsp; Here
a mob of armed servants, of lacqueys, and footboys, some bearing torches,
and some carrying their masters&rsquo; cloaks and <i>galoshes</i>, loitered
to and fro.&nbsp; Had M. de Tignonville been a little more observant,
or a trifle less occupied with his own importance, he might have noted
more than one face which looked darkly on him; he might have caught
more than one overt sneer at his expense.&nbsp; But in the business
of summoning Carlat&mdash;Mademoiselle de Vrillac&rsquo;s steward and
major-domo&mdash;he lost the contemptuous &ldquo;Christaudins!&rdquo;
that hissed from a footboy&rsquo;s lips, and the &ldquo;Southern dogs!&rdquo;
that died in the moustachios of a bully in the livery of the King&rsquo;s
brother.&nbsp; He was engaged in finding the steward, and in aiding
him to cloak his mistress; then with a ruffling air, a new acquirement,
which he had picked up since he came to Paris, he made a way for her
through the crowd.&nbsp; A moment, and the three, followed by half a
dozen armed servants, bearing pikes and torches, detached themselves
from the throng, and crossing the courtyard, with its rows of lighted
windows, passed out by the gate between the Tennis Courts, and so into
the Rue des Fosses de St. Germain.</p>
<p>Before them, against a sky in which the last faint glow of evening
still contended with the stars, the spire and pointed arches of the
church of St. Germain rose darkly graceful.&nbsp; It was something after
nine: the heat of the August day brooded over the crowded city, and
dulled the faint distant ring of arms and armour that yet would make
itself heard above the hush; a hush which was not silence so much as
a subdued hum.&nbsp; As Mademoiselle passed the closed house beside
the Cloister of St. Germain, where only the day before Admiral Coligny,
the leader of the Huguenots, had been wounded, she pressed her escort&rsquo;s
hand, and involuntarily drew nearer to him.&nbsp; But he laughed at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a private blow,&rdquo; he said, answering her unspoken
thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is like enough the Guises sped it.&nbsp; But
they know now what is the King&rsquo;s will, and they have taken the
hint and withdrawn themselves.&nbsp; It will not happen again, Mademoiselle.&nbsp;
For proof, see the guards&rdquo;&mdash;they were passing the end of
the Rue Bethizy, in the corner house of which, abutting on the Rue de
l&rsquo;Arbre Sec, Coligny had his lodgings&mdash;&ldquo;whom the King
has placed for his security.&nbsp; Fifty pikes under Cosseins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cosseins?&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I thought
Cosseins&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was not wont to love us!&rdquo; Tignonville answered, with
a confident chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was not.&nbsp; But the dogs lick
where the master wills, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; He was not, but he does.&nbsp;
This marriage has altered all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it may not prove an unlucky one!&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
She felt impelled to say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it!&rdquo; he answered confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped, as he spoke, before the last house, at the corner of
the Rue St. Honor&eacute; opposite the Croix du Tiroir; which rose shadowy
in the middle of the four ways.&nbsp; He hammered on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said softly, looking in his face, &ldquo;the
change is sudden, is it not?&nbsp; The King was not wont to be so good
to us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King was not King until now,&rdquo; he answered warmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is what I am trying to persuade our people.&nbsp; Believe
me, Mademoiselle, you may sleep without fear; and early in the morning
I will be with you.&nbsp; Carlat, have a care of your mistress until
morning, and let Madame lie in her chamber.&nbsp; She is nervous to-night.&nbsp;
There, sweet, until morning!&nbsp; God keep you, and pleasant dreams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He uncovered, and bowing over her hand, kissed it; and the door being
open he would have turned away.&nbsp; But she lingered as if unwilling
to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is&mdash;do you hear it&mdash;a stir in <i>that</i>
quarter?&rdquo; she said, pointing across the Rue St. Honor&eacute;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What lies there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northward?&nbsp; The markets,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
nothing.&nbsp; They say, you know, that Paris never sleeps.&nbsp; Good
night, sweet, and a fair awakening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shivered as she had shivered under Tavannes&rsquo; eye.&nbsp;
And still she lingered, keeping him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to your lodging at once?&rdquo; she asked&mdash;for
the sake, it seemed, of saying something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; he answered a little hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
I was thinking of paying Rochefoucauld the compliment of seeing him
home.&nbsp; He has taken a new lodging to be near the Admiral; a horrid
bare place in the Rue Bethizy, without furniture, but he would go into
it to-day.&nbsp; And he has a sort of claim on my family, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said simply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course.&nbsp;
Then I must not detain you.&nbsp; God keep you safe,&rdquo; she continued,
with a faint quiver in her tone; and her lip trembled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
night, and fair dreams, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He echoed the words gallantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of you, sweet!&rdquo;
he cried; and turning away with a gesture of farewell, he set off on
his return.</p>
<p>He walked briskly, nor did he look back, though she stood awhile
gazing after him.&nbsp; She was not aware that she gave thought to this;
nor that it hurt her.&nbsp; Yet when bolt and bar had shot behind her,
and she had mounted the cold, bare staircase of that day&mdash;when
she had heard the dull echoing footsteps of her attendants as they withdrew
to their lairs and sleeping-places, and still more when she had crossed
the threshold of her chamber, and signed to Madame Carlat and her woman
to listen&mdash;it is certain she felt a lack of something.</p>
<p>Perhaps the chill that possessed her came of that lack, which she
neither defined nor acknowledged.&nbsp; Or possibly it came of the night
air, August though it was; or of sheer nervousness, or of the remembrance
of Count Hannibal&rsquo;s smile.&nbsp; Whatever its origin, she took
it to bed with her and long after the house slept round her, long after
the crowded quarter of the Halles had begun to heave and the Sorbonne
to vomit a black-frocked band, long after the tall houses in the gabled
streets, from St. Antoine to Montmartre and from St. Denis on the north
to St. Jacques on the south, had burst into rows of twinkling lights&mdash;nay,
long after the Quarter of the Louvre alone remained dark, girdled by
this strange midnight brightness&mdash;she lay awake.&nbsp; At length
she too slept, and dreamed of home and the wide skies of Poitou, and
her castle of Vrillac washed day and night by the Biscay tides.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; HANNIBAL DE SAULX, COMTE DE TAVANNES.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes, we know, had been slow to obey the summons.&nbsp; Emerging
from the crowd, he found that the King, with Retz and Rambouillet, his
Marshal des Logis, had retired to the farther end of the Chamber; apparently
Charles had forgotten that he had called.&nbsp; His head a little bent&mdash;he
was tall and had a natural stoop&mdash;the King seemed to be listening
to a low but continuous murmur of voices which proceeded from the door
of his closet.&nbsp; One voice frequently raised was beyond doubt a
woman&rsquo;s; a foreign accent, smooth and silky, marked another; a
third, that from time to time broke in, wilful and impetuous, was the
voice of Monsieur, the King&rsquo;s brother, Catherine de M&eacute;dicis&rsquo;
favourite son.&nbsp; Tavannes, waiting respectfully two paces behind
the King, could catch little that was said; but Charles, something more,
it seemed, for on a sudden he laughed, a violent, mirthless laugh.&nbsp;
And he clapped Rambouillet on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, with one of his horrible oaths, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
settled!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis settled!&nbsp; Go, man, and take your orders!&nbsp;
And you, M. de Retz,&rdquo; he continued, in a tone of savage mockery,
&ldquo;go, my lord, and give them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sire?&rdquo; the Italian Marshal answered, in accents of
deprecation.&nbsp; There were times when the young King would show his
impatience of the Italian ring, the Retzs and Biragues, the Strozzis
and Gondys, with whom his mother surrounded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you!&rdquo; Charles answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You and my
lady mother!&nbsp; And in God&rsquo;s name answer for it at the day!&rdquo;
he continued vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will have it!&nbsp; You will
not let me rest till you have it!&nbsp; Then have it, only see to it,
it be done thoroughly!&nbsp; There shall not be one left to cast it
in the King&rsquo;s teeth and cry, &lsquo;Et tu, Carole!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Swim, swim in blood if you will,&rdquo; he continued, with growing wildness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;twill be a merry night!&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s true
so far, you may kill fleas all day, but burn the coat, and there&rsquo;s
an end.&nbsp; So burn it, burn it, and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke
off with a start as he discovered Tavannes at his elbow.&nbsp; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
death, man!&rdquo; he cried roughly, &ldquo;who sent for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty called me,&rdquo; Tavannes answered; while, partly
urged by the King&rsquo;s hand, and partly anxious to escape, the others
slipped into the closet and left them together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent for you?&nbsp; I called your brother, the Marshal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is within, sire,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, indicating the
closet.&nbsp; &ldquo;A moment ago I heard his voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles passed his shaking hand across his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
he?&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;So he is!&nbsp; I heard it too.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and a man cannot be in two places at once!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then,
while his haggard gaze, passing by Tavannes, roved round the Chamber,
he laid his hand on Count Hannibal&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
give me no peace, Madame and the Guises,&rdquo; he whispered, his face
hectic with excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;They will have it.&nbsp; They say
that Coligny&mdash;they say that he beards me in my own palace.&nbsp;
And&mdash;and, <i>mordieu</i>,&rdquo; with sudden violence, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
true.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true enough!&nbsp; It was but to-day he was for
making terms with me!&nbsp; With me, the King!&nbsp; Making terms!&nbsp;
So it shall be, by God and Devil, it shall!&nbsp; But not six or seven!&nbsp;
No, no.&nbsp; All!&nbsp; All!&nbsp; There shall not be one left to say
to me, &lsquo;You did it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly, sire,&rdquo; Tavannes answered; for Charles had gradually
raised his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time the young King&mdash;he was but twenty-two years
old, God pity him!&mdash;looked at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; he whispered; and his eyes grew cunning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides, and after all, there&rsquo;s another way, if I choose.&nbsp;
Oh, I&rsquo;ve thought and thought, I&rsquo;d have you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And shrugging his shoulders, almost to his ears, he raised and lowered
his open hands alternately, while his back hid the movement from the
Chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;See-saw!&nbsp; See-saw!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the King between the two, you see.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Madame&rsquo;s
king-craft.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s shown me that a hundred times.&nbsp; But
look you, it is as easy to lower the one as the other,&rdquo; with a
cunning glance at Tavannes&rsquo; face, &ldquo;or to cut off the right
as the left.&nbsp; And&mdash;and the Admiral&rsquo;s an old man and
will pass; and for the matter of that I like to hear him talk.&nbsp;
He talks well.&nbsp; While the others, Guise and his kind, are young,
and I&rsquo;ve thought, oh, yes, I&rsquo;ve thought&mdash;but there,&rdquo;
with a sudden harsh laugh, &ldquo;my lady mother will have it her own
way.&nbsp; And for this time she shall, but, All!&nbsp; All!&nbsp; Even
Foucauld, there!&nbsp; Do you mark him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s sorting the
cards.&nbsp; Do you see him&mdash;as he will be to-morrow, with the
slit in his throat and his teeth showing?&nbsp; Why, God!&rdquo; his
voice rising almost to a scream, &ldquo;the candles by him are burning
blue!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a shaking hand, his face convulsed, the
young King clutched his companion&rsquo;s arm, and pinched it.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal shrugged his shoulders, but answered nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think we shall see them afterwards?&rdquo; Charles
resumed, in a sharp, eager whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;In our dreams, man?&nbsp;
Or when the watchman cries, and we awake, and the monks are singing
lauds at St. Germain, and&mdash;and the taper is low?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes&rsquo; lip curled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dream, sire,&rdquo;
he answered coldly, &ldquo;and I seldom wake.&nbsp; For the rest, I
fear my enemies neither alive nor dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; By G-d, I wish I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
the young man exclaimed.&nbsp; His brow was wet with sweat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish I didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But there, it&rsquo;s settled.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
settled it, and I would it were done!&nbsp; What do you think of&mdash;of
it, man?&nbsp; What do you think of it, yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal&rsquo;s face was inscrutable.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
nothing, sire,&rdquo; he said dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is for your Majesty
and your council to think.&nbsp; It is enough for me that it is the
King&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not flinch?&rdquo; Charles muttered, with
a quick look of suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there,&rdquo; with a monstrous
oath, &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ll not!&nbsp; I believe you&rsquo;d as
soon kill a monk&mdash;though, thank God,&rdquo; and he crossed himself
devoutly, &ldquo;there is no question of that&mdash;as a man.&nbsp;
And sooner than a maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much sooner, sire,&rdquo; Tavannes answered grimly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you have any orders in the monkish direction&mdash;no?&nbsp;
Then your Majesty must not talk to me longer.&nbsp; M. de Rochefoucauld
is beginning to wonder what is keeping your Majesty from your game.&nbsp;
And others are marking you, sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Lord!&rdquo; Charles exclaimed, a ring of wonder mingled
with horror in his tone, &ldquo;if they knew what was in our minds they&rsquo;d
mark us more!&nbsp; Yet, see Nan&ccedil;ay there beside the door?&nbsp;
He is unmoved.&nbsp; He looks to-day as he looked yesterday.&nbsp; Yet
he has charge of the work in the palace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time Tavannes allowed a movement of surprise to escape
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the palace?&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it to be
done here, too, sire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you let some escape, to return by-and-by and cut our
throats?&rdquo; the King retorted, with a strange spirt of fury; an
incapacity to maintain the same attitude of mind for two minutes together
was the most fatal weakness of his ill-balanced nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp;
All!&nbsp; All!&rdquo; he repeated with vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
Noah people the earth with eight?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll not leave eight!&nbsp;
My cousins, for they are blood-royal, shall live if they will recant.&nbsp;
And my old nurse, whether or no.&nbsp; And Par&eacute;, for no one else
understands my complexion.&nbsp; And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rochefoucauld, doubtless, sire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, whose eye had sought his favourite companion, withdrew
it.&nbsp; He darted a glance at Tavannes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foucauld?&nbsp; Who said so?&rdquo; he muttered jealously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not I!&nbsp; But we shall see.&nbsp; We shall see!&nbsp; And
do you see that you spare no one, M. le Comte, without an order.&nbsp;
That is your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sire,&rdquo; Tavannes answered coolly.&nbsp;
And after a moment&rsquo;s silence, seeing that the King had done with
him, he bowed low and withdrew; watched by the circle, as all about
a King were watched in the days when a King&rsquo;s breath meant life
or death, and his smile made the fortunes of men.&nbsp; As he passed
Rochefoucauld, the latter looked up and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What keeps brother Charles?&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
madder than ever to-night.&nbsp; Is it a masque or a murder he is planning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vapours,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, with a sneer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Old tales his old nurse has stuffed him withal.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
come by-and-by, and &rsquo;twill be well if you can divert him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, if he come,&rdquo; Rochefoucauld answered, shuffling
the cards.&nbsp; &ldquo;If not &rsquo;tis Chicot&rsquo;s business, and
he should attend to it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired, and shall to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, and moved, as if to
go on.&nbsp; Then he paused for a last word.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will come,&rdquo;
he muttered, stooping and speaking under his breath, his eyes on the
other&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;But play him lightly.&nbsp; He is in
an ugly mood.&nbsp; Please him, if you can, and it may serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the two met an instant, and those of Foucauld&mdash;so
the King called his Huguenot favourite&mdash;betrayed some surprise;
for Count Hannibal and he were not intimate.&nbsp; But seeing that the
other was in earnest, he raised his brows in acknowledgment.&nbsp; Tavannes
nodded carelessly in return, looked an instant at the cards on the table,
and passed on, pushed his way through the circle, and reached the door.&nbsp;
He was lifting the curtain to go out, when Nan&ccedil;ay, the Captain
of the Guard, plucked his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been saying to Foucauld, M. de Tavannes?&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; with a jealous glance, &ldquo;you, M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal looked at him with the sudden ferocity that made the
man a proverb at Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I chose, M. le Capitaine des Suisses!&rdquo; he hissed.&nbsp;
And his hand closed like a vice on the other&rsquo;s wrist.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
I chose, look you! And remember, another time, that I am not a Huguenot,
and say what I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is great need of care,&rdquo; Nan&ccedil;ay protested,
stammering and flinching.&nbsp; &ldquo;And&mdash;and I have orders,
M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your orders are not for me,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, releasing
his arm with a contemptuous gesture.&nbsp; &ldquo;And look you, man,
do not cross my path to-night.&nbsp; You know our motto?&nbsp; Who touches
my brother, touches Tavannes!&nbsp; Be warned by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&ccedil;ay scowled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the priests say, &lsquo;If
your hand offend you, cut it off!&rsquo;&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Tavannes laughed, a sinister laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you offend me
I&rsquo;ll cut your throat,&rdquo; he said; and with no ceremony he
went out, and dropped the curtain behind him.</p>
<p>Nan&ccedil;ay looked after him, his face pale with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Curse
him!&rdquo; he whispered, rubbing his wrist.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he were
any one else I would teach him!&nbsp; But he would as soon run you through
in the presence as in the Pr&eacute; aux Clercs!&nbsp; And his brother,
the Marshal, has the King&rsquo;s ear!&nbsp; And Madame Catherine&rsquo;s
too, which is worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still fuming, when an officer in the colours of Monsieur,
the King&rsquo;s brother, entered hurriedly, and keeping his hand on
the curtain, looked anxiously round the Chamber.&nbsp; As soon as his
eye found Nan&ccedil;ay, his face cleared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the reckoning?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are seventeen Huguenots in the palace besides their
Highnesses,&rdquo; Nan&ccedil;ay replied, in the same cautious tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not counting two or three who are neither the one thing nor the
other.&nbsp; In addition, there are the two Montmorencies; but they
are to go safe for fear of their brother, who is not in the trap.&nbsp;
He is too like his father, the old Bench-burner, to be lightly wronged!&nbsp;
And, besides, there is Par&eacute;, who is to go to his Majesty&rsquo;s
closet as soon as the gates are shut.&nbsp; If the King decides to save
any one else, he will send him to his closet.&nbsp; So &rsquo;tis all
clear and arranged here.&nbsp; If you are forward outside, it will be
well!&nbsp; Who deals with the gentleman with the tooth-pick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Admiral?&nbsp; Monsieur, Guise, and the Grand Prior; Cosseins
and Besme have charge.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis to be done first.&nbsp; Then
the Provost will raise the town.&nbsp; He will have a body of stout
fellows ready at three or four rendezvous, so that the fire may blaze
up everywhere at once.&nbsp; Marcel, the ex-provost, has the same commission
south of the river.&nbsp; Orders to light the town as for a frolic have
been given, and the Halles will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&ccedil;ay nodded, reflected a moment, and then with an involuntary
shudder&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it will shake the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, will it not!&rdquo;&nbsp; His next words showed that he
bore Tavannes&rsquo; warning in mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;For me, my friend,
I go in mail to-night,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There will be many
a score paid before morning, besides his Majesty&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
many a left-handed blow will be struck in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other crossed himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grant none light here!&rdquo;
he said devoutly.&nbsp; And with a last look he nodded and went out.</p>
<p>In the doorway he jostled a person who was in the act of entering.&nbsp;
It was M. de Tignonville, who, seeing Nan&ccedil;ay at his elbow, saluted
him, and stood looking round.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s face was flushed,
his eyes were bright with unwonted excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Rochefoucauld?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
has not left yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan&ccedil;ay caught the thrill in his voice, and marked the young
man&rsquo;s flushed face and altered bearing.&nbsp; He noted, too, the
crumpled paper he carried half-hidden in his hand; and the Captain&rsquo;s
countenance grew dark.&nbsp; He drew a step nearer, and his hand reached
softly for his dagger.&nbsp; But his voice, when he spoke, was smooth
as the surface of the pleasure-loving Court, smooth as the externals
of all things in Paris that summer evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here still,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you news,
M. de Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For M. de Rochefoucauld?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am here to see him to his lodging, that is all.&nbsp; News, Captain?&nbsp;
What made you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which you have in your hand,&rdquo; Nan&ccedil;ay answered,
his fears relieved.</p>
<p>The young man blushed to the roots of his hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not for him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that, Monsieur,&rdquo; Nan&ccedil;ay answered politely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has his successes, but all the billets-doux do not go one
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man laughed, a conscious, flattered laugh.&nbsp; He was
handsome, with such a face as women love, but there was a lack of ease
in the way he wore his Court suit.&nbsp; It was a trifle finer, too,
than accorded with Huguenot taste; or it looked the finer for the way
he wore it, even as Teligny&rsquo;s and Foucauld&rsquo;s velvet capes
and stiff brocades lost their richness and became but the adjuncts,
fitting and graceful, of the men.&nbsp; Odder still, as Tignonville
laughed, half hiding and half revealing the dainty scented paper in
his hand, his clothes seemed smarter and he more awkward than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is from a lady,&rdquo; he admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But a
bit of badinage, I assure you, nothing more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understood!&rdquo;&nbsp; M. de Nan&ccedil;ay murmured politely.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say I congratulate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand.&nbsp; And see, the King is about to rise.&nbsp;
Go forward, Monsieur,&rdquo; he continued benevolently.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
young man should show himself.&nbsp; Besides, his Majesty likes you
well,&rdquo; he added, with a leer.&nbsp; He had an unpleasant sense
of humour, had his Majesty&rsquo;s Captain of the Guard; and this evening
somewhat more than ordinary on which to exercise it.</p>
<p>Tignonville held too good an opinion of himself to suspect the other
of badinage; and thus encouraged, he pushed his way to the front of
the circle.&nbsp; During his absence with his betrothed, the crowd in
the Chamber had grown thin, the candles had burned an inch shorter in
the sconces.&nbsp; But though many who had been there had left, the
more select remained, and the King&rsquo;s return to his seat had given
the company a fillip.&nbsp; An air of feverish gaiety, common in the
unhealthy life of the Court, prevailed.&nbsp; At a table abreast of
the King, Montpensier and Marshal Coss&eacute; were dicing and disputing,
with now a yell of glee, and now an oath, that betrayed which way fortune
inclined.&nbsp; At the back of the King&rsquo;s chair, Chicot, his gentleman-jester,
hung over Charles&rsquo;s shoulder, now scanning his cards, and now
making hideous faces that threw the on-lookers into fits of laughter.&nbsp;
Farther up the Chamber, at the end of the alcove, Marshal Tavannes&mdash;our
Hannibal&rsquo;s brother&mdash;occupied a low stool, which was set opposite
the open door of the closet.&nbsp; Through this doorway a slender foot,
silk-clad, shot now and again into sight; it came, it vanished, it came
again, the gallant Marshal striving at each appearance to rob it of
its slipper, a dainty jewelled thing of crimson velvet.&nbsp; He failed
thrice, a peal of laughter greeting each failure.&nbsp; At the fourth
essay, he upset his stool and fell to the floor, but held the slipper.&nbsp;
And not the slipper only, but the foot.&nbsp; Amid a flutter of silken
skirts and dainty laces&mdash;while the hidden beauty shrilly protested&mdash;he
dragged first the ankle, and then a shapely leg into sight.&nbsp; The
circle applauded; the lady, feeling herself still drawn on, screamed
loudly and more loudly.&nbsp; All save the King and his opponent turned
to look.&nbsp; And then the sport came to a sudden end.&nbsp; A sinewy
hand appeared, interposed, released; for an instant the dark, handsome
face of Guise looked through the doorway.&nbsp; It was gone as soon
as seen; it was there a second only.&nbsp; But more than one recognised
it, and wondered.&nbsp; For was not the young Duke in evil odour with
the King by reason of the attack on the Admiral?&nbsp; And had he not
been chased from Paris only that morning and forbidden to return?</p>
<p>They were still wondering, still gazing, when abruptly&mdash;as he
did all things&mdash;Charles thrust back his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foucauld, you owe me ten pieces!&rdquo; he cried with glee,
and he slapped the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pay, my friend; pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, little master; to-morrow!&rdquo; Rochefoucauld
answered in the same tone.&nbsp; And he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; Charles repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And on the word his jaw fell.&nbsp; He looked wildly round.&nbsp; His
face was ghastly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sire, and why not?&rdquo; Rochefoucauld answered in
astonishment.&nbsp; And in his turn he looked round, wondering; and
a chill fell on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>For a moment no one answered him: the silence in the Chamber was
intense.&nbsp; Where he looked, wherever he looked, he met solemn, wondering
eyes, such eyes as gaze on men in their coffins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has come to you all?&rdquo; he cried, with an effort.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the jest, for faith, sire, I don&rsquo;t see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King seemed incapable of speech, and it was Chicot who filled
the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pretty apparent,&rdquo; he said, with a rude laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The cock will lay and Foucauld will pay&mdash;to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young nobleman&rsquo;s colour rose; between him and the Gascon
gentleman was no love lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some debts I pay to-day,&rdquo; he cried haughtily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For the rest, farewell my little master!&nbsp; When one does
not understand the jest it is time to be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was halfway to the door, watched by all, when the King spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foucauld!&rdquo; he cried, in an odd, strangled voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Foucauld!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Huguenot favourite turned back,
wondering.&nbsp; &ldquo;One minute!&rdquo; the King continued, in the
same forced voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay till morning&mdash;in my closet.&nbsp;
It is late now.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll play away the rest of the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty must excuse me,&rdquo; Rochefoucauld answered
frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am dead asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sleep in the Garde-Robe,&rdquo; the King persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing, sire!&rdquo; was the gay answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know that bed!&nbsp; I shall sleep longer and better in my
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King shuddered, but strove to hide the movement under a shrug
of his shoulders.&nbsp; He turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is God&rsquo;s will!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; He was white
to the lips.</p>
<p>Rochefoucauld did not catch the words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good night, sire,&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell, little master.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with
a nod here and there, he passed to the door, followed by Mergey and
Chamont, two gentlemen of his suite.</p>
<p>Nan&ccedil;ay raised the curtain with an obsequious gesture.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pardon me, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you go to his
Highness&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few minutes, Nan&ccedil;ay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to go with you.&nbsp; The guards may be set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so, my friend,&rdquo; Rochefoucauld answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
Tignonville, is it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come to attend you to your lodging,&rdquo; the young
man said.&nbsp; And he ranged up beside the other, as, the curtain fallen
behind them, they walked along the gallery.</p>
<p>Rochefoucauld stopped and laid his hand on Tignonville&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, dear lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I am going to
the Princess Dowager&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Afterwards to his Highness&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
I may be detained an hour or more.&nbsp; You will not like to wait so
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s face fell ludicrously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
no,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I could
wait so long&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come to-morrow night,&rdquo; Rochefoucauld answered,
with good nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; the other cried heartily, his relief
evident.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; With pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
nodding good night, they parted.</p>
<p>While Rochefoucauld, with Nan&ccedil;ay at his side and his gentlemen
attending him, passed along the echoing and now empty gallery, the younger
man bounded down the stairs to the great hall of the Caryatides, his
face radiant.&nbsp; He for one was not sleepy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; THE HOUSE NEXT THE GOLDEN MAID.</h2>
<p>We have it on record that before the Comte de la Rochefoucauld left
the Louvre that night he received the strongest hints of the peril which
threatened him; and at least one written warning was handed to him by
a stranger in black, and by him in turn was communicated to the King
of Navarre.&nbsp; We are told further that when he took his final leave,
about the hour of eleven, he found the courtyard brilliantly lighted,
and the three companies of guards&mdash;Swiss, Scotch, and French&mdash;drawn
up in ranked array from the door of the great hall to the gate which
opened on the street.&nbsp; But, the chronicler adds, neither this precaution,
sinister as it appeared to some of his suite, nor the grave farewell
which Rambouillet, from his post at the gate, took of one of his gentlemen,
shook that chivalrous soul or sapped its generous confidence.</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville was young and less versed in danger than the Governor
of Rochelle; with him, had he seen so much, it might have been different.&nbsp;
But he left the Louvre an hour earlier&mdash;at a time when the precincts
of the palace, gloomy-seeming to us in the light cast by coming events,
wore their wonted aspect.&nbsp; His thoughts, moreover, as he crossed
the courtyard, were otherwise employed.&nbsp; So much so, indeed, that
though he signed to his two servants to follow him, he seemed barely
conscious what he was doing; nor did he shake off his reverie until
he reached the corner of the Rue Baillet.&nbsp; Here the voices of the
Swiss who stood on guard opposite Coligny&rsquo;s lodgings, at the end
of the Rue Bethizy, could be plainly heard.&nbsp; They had kindled a
fire in an iron basket set in the middle of the road, and knots of them
were visible in the distance, moving to and fro about their piled arms.</p>
<p>Tignonville paused before he came within the radius of the firelight,
and, turning, bade his servants take their way home.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall follow, but I have business first,&rdquo; he added curtly.</p>
<p>The elder of the two demurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;The streets are not too
safe,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;In two hours or less, my lord, it
will be midnight.&nbsp; And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, booby; do you think I am a child?&rdquo; his master retorted
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my sword and can use it.&nbsp; I shall
not be long.&nbsp; And do you hear, men, keep a still tongue, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, country fellows, obeyed reluctantly, and with a full intention
of sneaking after him the moment he had turned his back.&nbsp; But he
suspected them of this, and stood where he was until they had passed
the fire, and could no longer detect his movements.&nbsp; Then he plunged
quickly into the Rue Baillet, gained through it the Rue du Roule, and
traversing that also, turned to the right into the Rue Ferronerie, the
main thoroughfare, east and west, of Paris.&nbsp; Here he halted in
front of the long, dark outer wall of the Cemetery of the Innocents,
in which, across the tombstones and among the sepulchres of dead Paris,
the living Paris of that day, bought and sold, walked, gossiped, and
made love.</p>
<p>About him things were to be seen that would have seemed stranger
to him had he been less strange to the city.&nbsp; From the quarter
of the markets north of him, a quarter which fenced in the cemetery
on two sides, the same dull murmur proceeded, which Mademoiselle de
Vrillac had remarked an hour earlier.&nbsp; The sky above the cemetery
glowed with reflected light, the cause of which was not far to seek,
for every window of the tall houses that overlooked it, and the huddle
of booths about it, contributed a share of the illumination.&nbsp; At
an hour late even for Paris, an hour when honest men should have been
sunk in slumber, this strange brilliance did for a moment perplex him;
but the past week had been so full of f&ecirc;tes, of masques and frolics,
often devised on the moment and dependent on the King&rsquo;s whim,
that he set this also down to such a cause, and wondered no more.</p>
<p>The lights in the houses did not serve the purpose he had in his
mind, but beside the closed gate of the cemetery, and between two stalls,
was a votive lamp burning before an image of the Mother and Child.&nbsp;
He crossed to this, and assuring himself by a glance to right and left
that he stood in no danger from prowlers, he drew a note from his breast.&nbsp;
It had been slipped into his hand in the gallery before he saw Mademoiselle
to her lodging; it had been in his possession barely an hour.&nbsp;
But brief as its contents were, and easily committed to memory, he had
perused it thrice already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the house next the Golden Maid, Rue Cinq Diamants, an hour
before midnight, you may find the door open should you desire to talk
farther with C. St. L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he read it for the fourth time the light of the lamp fell athwart
his face; and even as his fine clothes had never seemed to fit him worse
than when he faintly denied the imputations of gallantry launched at
him by Nan&ccedil;ay, so his features had never looked less handsome
than they did now.&nbsp; The glow of vanity which warmed his cheek as
he read the message, the smile of conceit which wreathed his lips, bespoke
a nature not of the most noble; or the lamp did him less than justice.&nbsp;
Presently he kissed the note, and hid it.&nbsp; He waited until the
clock of St. Jacques struck the hour before midnight; and then moving
forward, he turned to the right by way of the narrow neck leading to
the Rue Lombard.&nbsp; He walked in the kennel here, his sword in his
hand and his eyes looking to right and left; for the place was notorious
for robberies.&nbsp; But though he saw more than one figure lurking
in a doorway or under the arch that led to a passage, it vanished on
his nearer approach.&nbsp; In less than a minute he reached the southern
end of the street that bore the odd title of the Five Diamonds.</p>
<p>Situate in the crowded quarter of the butchers, and almost in the
shadow of their famous church, this street&mdash;which farther north
was continued in the Rue Quimcampoix&mdash;presented in those days a
not uncommon mingling of poverty and wealth.&nbsp; On one side of the
street a row of lofty gabled houses, built under Francis the First,
sheltered persons of good condition; on the other, divided from these
by the width of the road and a reeking kennel, a row of peat-houses,
the hovels of cobblers and sausage-makers, leaned against shapeless
timber houses which tottered upwards in a medley of sagging roofs and
bulging gutters.&nbsp; Tignonville was strange to the place, and nine
nights out of ten he would have been at a disadvantage.&nbsp; But, thanks
to the tapers that to-night shone in many windows, he made out enough
to see that he need search only the one side; and with a beating heart
he passed along the row of newer houses, looking eagerly for the sign
of the Golden Maid.</p>
<p>He found it at last; and then for a moment he stood puzzled.&nbsp;
The note said, next door to the Golden Maid, but it did not say on which
side.&nbsp; He scrutinised the nearer house, but he saw nothing to determine
him; and he was proceeding to the farther, when he caught sight of two
men, who, ambushed behind a horse-block on the opposite side of the
roadway, seemed to be watching his movements.&nbsp; Their presence flurried
him; but much to his relief his next glance at the houses showed him
that the door of the farther one was unlatched.&nbsp; It stood slightly
ajar, permitting a beam of light to escape into the street.</p>
<p>He stepped quickly to it&mdash;the sooner he was within the house
the better&mdash;pushed the door open and entered.&nbsp; As soon as
he was inside he tried to close the entrance behind him, but he found
he could not; the door would not shut.&nbsp; After a brief trial he
abandoned the attempt and passed quickly on, through a bare lighted
passage which led to the foot of a staircase, equally bare.&nbsp; He
stood at this point an instant and listened, in the hope that Madame&rsquo;s
maid would come to him.&nbsp; At first he heard nothing save his own
breathing; then a gruff voice from above startled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Monsieur,&rdquo; it said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are early,
but not too soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Madame trusted her footman!&nbsp; M. de Tignonville shrugged his
shoulders; but after all, it was no affair of his, and he went up.&nbsp;
Halfway to the top, however, he stood, an oath on his lips.&nbsp; Two
men had entered by the open door below&mdash;even as he had entered!&nbsp;
And as quietly!</p>
<p>The imprudence of it!&nbsp; The imprudence of leaving the door so
that it could not be closed!&nbsp; He turned, and descended to meet
them, his teeth set, his hand on his sword, one conjecture after another
whirling in his brain.&nbsp; Was he beset?&nbsp; Was it a trap?&nbsp;
Was it a rival?&nbsp; Was it chance?&nbsp; Two steps he descended; and
then the voice he had heard before cried again, but more imperatively&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur, this way!&nbsp; Did you not hear me?&nbsp; This
way, and be quick, if you please.&nbsp; By-and-by there will be a crowd,
and then the more we have dealt with the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew now that he had made a mistake, that he had entered the wrong
house; and naturally his impulse was to continue his descent and secure
his retreat.&nbsp; But the pause had brought the two men who had entered
face to face with him, and they showed no signs of giving way.&nbsp;
On the contrary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room is above, Monsieur,&rdquo; the foremost said, in
a matter-of-fact tone, and with a slight salutation.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
you, if you please,&rdquo; and he signed to him to return.</p>
<p>He was a burly man, grim and truculent in appearance, and his follower
was like him.&nbsp; Tignonville hesitated, then turned and ascended.&nbsp;
But as soon as he had reached the landing where they could pass him,
he turned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made a mistake, I think,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have entered the wrong house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you for the house next the Golden Maid, Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rue Cinq Diamants, Quarter of the Boucherie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mistake, then,&rdquo; the stout man replied firmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are early, that is all.&nbsp; You have arms, I see.&nbsp;
Maillard!&rdquo;&mdash;to the person whose voice Tignonville had heard
at the head of the stairs&mdash;&ldquo;A white sleeve, and a cross for
Monsieur&rsquo;s hat, and his name on the register.&nbsp; Come, make
a beginning!&nbsp; Make a beginning, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Monsieur.&nbsp; All is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then lose no time, I say.&nbsp; Here are others, also early
in the good cause.&nbsp; Gentlemen, welcome!&nbsp; Welcome all who are
for the true faith!&nbsp; Death to the heretics!&nbsp; &lsquo;Kill,
and no quarter!&rsquo; is the word to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death to the heretics!&rdquo; the last comers cried in chorus.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Kill and no quarter!&nbsp; At what hour, M. le Pr&eacute;vot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At daybreak,&rdquo; the Provost answered importantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But have no fear, the tocsin will sound.&nbsp; The King and our
good man M. de Guise have all in hand.&nbsp; A white sleeve, a white
cross, and a sharp knife shall rid Paris of the vermin!&nbsp; Gentlemen
of the quarter, the word of the night is &lsquo;Kill, and no quarter!&nbsp;
Death to the Huguenots!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death!&nbsp; Death to the Huguenots!&nbsp; Kill, and no quarter!&rdquo;
A dozen&mdash;the room was beginning to fill&mdash;waved their weapons
and echoed the cry.</p>
<p>Tignonville had been fortunate enough to apprehend the position&mdash;and
the peril in which he stood&mdash;before Maillard advanced to him bearing
a white linen sleeve.&nbsp; In the instant of discovery his heart had
stood a moment, the blood had left his cheeks; but with some faults,
he was no coward, and he managed to hide his emotion.&nbsp; He held
out his left arm, and suffered the beadle to pass the sleeve over it
and to secure the white linen above the elbow.&nbsp; Then at a gesture
he gave up his velvet cap, and saw it decorated with a white cross of
the same material.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the register, Monsieur,&rdquo; Maillard continued briskly;
and waving him in the direction of a clerk, who sat at the end of the
long table, having a book and a ink-horn before him, he turned to the
next comer.</p>
<p>Tignonville would fain have avoided the ordeal of the register, but
the clerk&rsquo;s eye was on him.&nbsp; He had been fortunate so far,
but he knew that the least breath of suspicion would destroy him, and
summoning his wits together he gave his name in a steady voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anne Desmartins.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was his mother&rsquo;s maiden
name, and the first that came into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently; by birth, of the Limousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, Monsieur,&rdquo; the clerk answered, writing in the
name.&nbsp; And he turned to the next.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE EVE OF THE FEAST.</h2>
<p>It was Tignonville&rsquo;s salvation that the men who crowded the
long white-walled room, and exchanged vile boasts under the naked flaring
lights, were of all classes.&nbsp; There were butchers, natives of the
surrounding quarter whom the scent of blood had drawn from their lairs;
and there were priests with hatchet faces, who whispered in the butchers&rsquo;
ears.&nbsp; There were gentlemen of the robe, and plain mechanics, rich
merchants in their gowns, and bare-armed ragpickers, sleek choristers,
and shabby led-captains; but differ as they might in other points, in
one thing all were alike.&nbsp; From all, gentle or simple, rose the
same cry for blood, the same aspiration to be first equipped for the
fray.&nbsp; In one corner a man of rank stood silent and apart, his
hand on his sword, the working of his face alone betraying the storm
that reigned within.&nbsp; In another, a Norman horse-dealer talked
in low whispers with two thieves.&nbsp; In a third, a gold-wire drawer
addressed an admiring group from the Sorbonne; and meantime the middle
of the floor grew into a seething mass of muttering, scowling men, through
whom the last comers, thrust as they might, had much ado to force their
way.</p>
<p>And from all under the low ceiling rose a ceaseless hum, though none
spoke loud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kill! kill! kill!&rdquo; was the burden; the
accompaniment such profanities and blasphemies as had long disgraced
the Paris pulpits, and day by day had fanned the bigotry&mdash;already
at a white heat&mdash;of the Parisian populace.&nbsp; Tignonville turned
sick as he listened, and would fain have closed his ears.&nbsp; But
for his life he dared not.&nbsp; And presently a cripple in a beggar&rsquo;s
garb, a dwarfish, filthy creature with matted hair, twitched his sleeve,
and offered him a whetstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sharp, noble sir?&rdquo; he asked, with a leer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you sharp?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s surprising how the edge goes
on the bone.&nbsp; A cut and thrust?&nbsp; Well, every man to his taste.&nbsp;
But give me a broad butcher&rsquo;s knife and I&rsquo;ll ask no help,
be it man, woman, or child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bystander, a lean man in rusty black, chuckled as he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the woman or the child for choice, eh, Jehan?&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; And he looked to Tignonville to join in the jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, give me a white throat for choice!&rdquo; the cripple
answered, with horrible zest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And there&rsquo;ll be delicate
necks to prick to-night!&nbsp; Lord, I think I hear them squeal!&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t need it, sir?&rdquo; he continued, again proffering
the whetstone.&nbsp; &ldquo;No?&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll give my blade
another whet, in the name of our Lady, the Saints, and good Father Pezelay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and give me a turn!&rdquo; the lean man cried, proffering
his weapon.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I die if I do not kill one of the accursed
for every finger of my hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And toe of my feet!&rdquo; the cripple answered, not to be
outdone.&nbsp; &ldquo;And toe of my feet!&nbsp; A full score!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis according to your sins!&rdquo; the other, who had
something of the air of a Churchman, answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The more
heretics killed, the more sins forgiven.&nbsp; Remember that, brother,
and spare not if your soul be burdened!&nbsp; They blaspheme God and
call Him paste!&nbsp; In the paste of their own blood,&rdquo; he continued
ferociously, &ldquo;I will knead them and roll them out, saith the good
Father Pezelay, my master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cripple crossed himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom God keep,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a good man.&nbsp; But you are looking ill,
noble sir?&rdquo; he continued, peering curiously at the young Huguenot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the heat,&rdquo; Tignonville muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
night is stifling, and the lights make it worse.&nbsp; I will go nearer
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hoped to escape them; he had some hope even of escaping from the
room and giving the alarm.&nbsp; But when he had forced his way to the
threshold, he found it guarded by two pikemen; and glancing back to
see if his movements were observed&mdash;for he knew that his agitation
might have awakened suspicion&mdash;he found that the taller of the
two whom he had left, the black-garbed man with the hungry face, was
watching him a-tiptoe, over the shoulders of the crowd.</p>
<p>With that, and the sense of his impotence, the lights began to swim
before his eyes.&nbsp; The catastrophe that overhung his party, the
fate so treacherously prepared for all whom he loved and all with whom
his fortunes were bound up, confused his brain almost to delirium.&nbsp;
He strove to think, to calculate chances, to imagine some way in which
he might escape from the room, or from a window might cry the alarm.&nbsp;
But he could not bring his mind to a point.&nbsp; Instead, in lightning
flashes he foresaw what must happen: his betrothed in the hands of the
murderers; the fair face that had smiled on him frozen with terror;
brave men, the fighters of Montauban, the defenders of Angely, strewn
dead through the dark lanes of the city.&nbsp; And now a gust of passion,
and now a shudder of fear, seized him; and in any other assembly his
agitation must have led to detection.&nbsp; But in that room were many
twitching faces and trembling hands.&nbsp; Murder, cruel, midnight,
and most foul, wrung even from the murderers her toll of horror.&nbsp;
While some, to hide the nervousness they felt, babbled of what they
would do, others betrayed by the intentness with which they awaited
the signal, the dreadful anticipations that possessed their souls.</p>
<p>Before he had formed any plan, a movement took place near the door.&nbsp;
The stairs shook beneath the sudden trampling of feet, a voice cried
&ldquo;De par le Roi!&nbsp; De par le Roi!&rdquo; and the babel of the
room died down.&nbsp; The throng swayed and fell back on either hand,
and Marshal Tavannes entered, wearing half armour, with a white sash;
he was followed by six or eight gentlemen in like guise.&nbsp; Amid
cries of &ldquo;Jarnac!&nbsp; Jarnac!&rdquo;&mdash;for to him the credit
of that famous fight, nominally won by the King&rsquo;s brother, was
popularly given&mdash;he advanced up the room, met the Provost of the
merchants, and began to confer with him.&nbsp; Apparently he asked the
latter to select some men who could be trusted on a special mission,
for the Provost looked round and beckoned to his side one or two of
higher rank than the herd, and then one or two of the most truculent
aspect.</p>
<p>Tignonville trembled lest he should be singled out.&nbsp; He had
hidden himself as well as he could at the rear of the crowd by the door;
but his dress, so much above the common, rendered him conspicuous.&nbsp;
He fancied that the Provost&rsquo;s eye ranged the crowd for him; and
to avoid it and efface himself he moved a pace to his left.</p>
<p>The step was fatal.&nbsp; It saved him from the Provost, but it brought
him face to face and eye to eye with Count Hannibal, who stood in the
first rank at his brother&rsquo;s elbow.&nbsp; Tavannes stared an instant
as if he doubted his eyesight.&nbsp; Then, as doubt gave slow place
to certainty, and surprise to amazement, he smiled.&nbsp; And after
a moment he looked another way.</p>
<p>Tignonville&rsquo;s heart gave a great bump and seemed to stand still.&nbsp;
The lights whirled before his eyes, there was a roaring in his ears.&nbsp;
He waited for the word that should denounce him.&nbsp; It did not come.&nbsp;
And still it did not come; and Marshal Tavannes was turning.&nbsp; Yes,
turning, and going; the Provost, bowing low, was attending him to the
door; his suite were opening on either side to let him pass.&nbsp; And
Count Hannibal?&nbsp; Count Hannibal was following also, as if nothing
had occurred.&nbsp; As if he had seen nothing!</p>
<p>The young man caught his breath.&nbsp; Was it possible that he had
imagined the start of recognition, the steady scrutiny, the sinister
smile?&nbsp; No; for as Tavannes followed the others, he hung an instant
on his heel, their eyes met again, and once more he smiled.&nbsp; In
the next breath he was gone through the doorway, his spurs rang on the
stairs; and the babel of the crowd, checked by the great man&rsquo;s
presence, broke out anew, and louder.</p>
<p>Tignonville shuddered.&nbsp; He was saved as by a miracle; saved,
he did not know how.&nbsp; But the respite, though its strangeness diverted
his thoughts for a while, brought short relief.&nbsp; The horrors which
impended over others surged afresh into his mind, and filled him with
a maddening sense of impotence.&nbsp; To be one hour, only one short
half-hour without!&nbsp; To run through the sleeping streets, and scream
in the dull ears which a King&rsquo;s flatteries had stopped as with
wool!&nbsp; To go up and down and shake into life the guests whose royal
lodgings daybreak would turn to a shambles reeking with their blood!&nbsp;
They slept, the gentle Teligny, the brave Pardaillan, the gallant Rochefoucauld,
Piles the hero of St. Jean, while the cruel city stirred rustling about
them, and doom crept whispering to the door.&nbsp; They slept, they
and a thousand others, gentle and simple, young and old; while the half-mad
Valois shifted between two opinions, and the Italian woman, accursed
daughter of an accursed race, cried, &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; at her window,
and looked eastwards for the dawn.</p>
<p>And the women?&nbsp; The woman he was to marry?&nbsp; And the others?&nbsp;
In an access of passion he thrust aside those who stood between, he
pushed his way, disregarding complaints, disregarding opposition, to
the door.&nbsp; But the pikes lay across it, and he could not utter
a syllable to save his life.&nbsp; He would have flung himself on the
doorkeepers, for he was losing control of himself; but as he drew back
for the spring, a hand clutched his sleeve, and a voice he loathed hummed
in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, fair play, noble sir; fair play!&rdquo; the cripple Jehan
muttered, forcibly drawing him aside.&nbsp; &ldquo;All start together,
and it&rsquo;s no man&rsquo;s loss.&nbsp; But if there is any little
business,&rdquo; he continued, lowering his tone and peering with a
cunning look into the other&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;of your own, noble
sir, or your friends&rsquo;, anything or anybody you want despatched,
count on me.&nbsp; It were better, perhaps, you didn&rsquo;t appear
in it yourself, and a man you can trust&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; the young man cried, recoiling from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to look surprised, noble sir,&rdquo; the lean man,
who had joined them, answered in a soothing tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who kills
to-night does God service, and who serves God much may serve himself
a little.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out
the corn,&rsquo; says good Father Pezelay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; the cripple chimed in eagerly, his impatience
such that he danced on his toes.&nbsp; &ldquo;He preaches as well as
the good father his master!&nbsp; So frankly, noble sir, what is it?&nbsp;
What is it?&nbsp; A woman grown ugly?&nbsp; A rich man grown old, with
perchance a will in his chest?&nbsp; Or a young heir that stands in
my lord&rsquo;s way?&nbsp; Whichever it be, or whatever it be, trust
me and our friend here, and my butcher&rsquo;s gully shall cut the knot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But something there is,&rdquo; the lean man persisted obstinately;
and he cast a suspicious glance at Tignonville&rsquo;s clothes.&nbsp;
It was evident that the two had discussed him, and the motives of his
presence there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have the dice proved fickle, my lord, and
are you for the jewellers&rsquo; shops on the bridge to fill your purse
again?&nbsp; If so, take my word, it were better to go three than one,
and we&rsquo;ll enlist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, we know shops on the bridge where you can plunge your
arm elbow-deep in gold,&rdquo; the cripple muttered, his eyes sparkling
greedily.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Baillet&rsquo;s, noble sir!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a shop for you!&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s
shop who works for the King.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s lame like me.&nbsp; And
I know the way to all.&nbsp; Oh, it will be a merry night if they ring
before the dawn.&nbsp; It must be near daybreak now.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ay, what was it?&nbsp; A score of voices called for silence; a breathless
hush fell on the crowd.&nbsp; A moment the fiercest listened, with parted
lips and starting eyes.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;It was the bell!&rdquo; cried
one, &ldquo;let us out!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It was not!&rdquo; cried
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a pistol shot!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyhow
let us out!&rdquo; the crowd roared in chorus; &ldquo;let us out!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And they pressed in a furious mass towards the door, as if they would
force it, signal or no signal.</p>
<p>But the pikemen stood fast, and the throng, checked in their first
rush, turned on one another, and broke into wrangling and disputing;
boasting, and calling Heaven and the saints to witness how thoroughly,
how pitilessly, how remorselessly they would purge Paris of this leprosy
when the signal did sound.&nbsp; Until again above the babel a man cried
&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; and again they listened.&nbsp; And this time,
dulled by walls and distance, but unmistakable by the ears of fear or
hate, the heavy note of a bell came to them on the hot night air.&nbsp;
It was the boom, sullen and menacing, of the death signal.</p>
<p>The doorkeepers lowered their pikes, and with a wild rush, as of
wolves swarming on their prey, the band stormed the door, and thrust
and struggled and battled a way down the narrow staircase, and along
the narrow passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bas les Huguenots!&nbsp; Mort aux
Huguenots!&rdquo; they shouted; and shrieking, sweating, spurning with
vile hands, viler faces, they poured pell-mell into the street, and
added their clamour to the boom of the tocsin that, as by magic and
in a moment, turned the streets of Paris into a hell of blood and cruelty.&nbsp;
For as it was here, so it was in a dozen other quarters.</p>
<p>Quickly as they streamed out&mdash;and to have issued more quickly
would have been impossible&mdash;fiercely as they pushed and fought
and clove their way, Tignonville was of the foremost.&nbsp; And for
a moment, seeing the street clear before him and almost empty, the Huguenot
thought that he might do something.&nbsp; He might outstrip the stream
of rapine, he might carry the alarm; at worst he might reach his betrothed
before harm befell her.&nbsp; But when he had sped fifty yards, his
heart sank.&nbsp; True, none passed him; but under the spell of the
alarm-bell the stones themselves seemed to turn to men.&nbsp; Houses,
courts, alleys, the very churches vomited men.&nbsp; In a twinkling
the street was alive with men, roared with them as with a rushing tide,
gleamed with their lights and weapons, thundered with the volume of
their thousand voices.&nbsp; He was no longer ahead, men were running
before him, behind him, on his right hand and on his left.&nbsp; In
every side-street, every passage, men were running; and not men only,
but women, children, furious creatures without age or sex.&nbsp; And
all the time the bell tolled overhead, tolled faster and faster, and
louder and louder; and shots and screams, and the clash of arms, and
the fall of strong doors began to swell the maelstrom of sound.</p>
<p>He was in the Rue St. Honor&eacute; now, and speeding westward.&nbsp;
But the flood still rose with him, and roared abreast of him.&nbsp;
Nay, it outstripped him.&nbsp; When he came, panting, within sight of
his goal, and lacked but a hundred paces of it, he found his passage
barred by a dense mass of people moving slowly to meet him.&nbsp; In
the heart of the press the light of a dozen torches shone on half as
many riders mailed and armed; whose eyes, as they moved on, and the
furious gleaming eyes of the rabble about them, never left the gabled
roofs on their right.&nbsp; On these from time to time a white-clad
figure showed itself, and passed from chimney-stack to chimney-stack,
or, stooping low, ran along the parapet.&nbsp; Every time that this
happened, the men on horseback pointed upwards and the mob foamed with
rage.</p>
<p>Tignonville groaned, but he could not help.&nbsp; Unable to go forward,
he turned, and with others hurrying, shouting, and brandishing weapons,
he pressed into the Rue du Roule, passed through it, and gained the
Bethizy.&nbsp; But here, as he might have foreseen, all passage was
barred at the H&ocirc;tel Ponthieu by a horde of savages, who danced
and yelled and sang songs round the Admiral&rsquo;s body, which lay
in the middle of the way; while to right and left men were bursting
into houses and forcing new victims into the street.&nbsp; The worst
had happened there, and he turned panting, regained the Rue St. Honor&eacute;,
and, crossing it and turning left-handed, darted through side streets
until he came again into the main thoroughfare a little beyond the Croix
du Tiroir, that marked the corner of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Here his last hope left him.&nbsp; The street swarmed with bands
of men hurrying to and fro as in a sacked city.&nbsp; The scum of the
Halles, the rabble of the quarter poured this way and that, here at
random, there swayed and directed by a few knots of men-at-arms, whose
corselets reflected the glare of a hundred torches.&nbsp; At one time
and within sight, three or four houses were being stormed.&nbsp; On
every side rose heart-rending cries, mingled with brutal laughter, with
savage jests, with cries of &ldquo;To the river!&rdquo;&nbsp; The most
cruel of cities had burst its bounds and was not to be stayed; nor would
be stayed until the Seine ran red to the sea, and leagues below, in
pleasant Normandy hamlets, men, for fear of the pestilence, pushed the
corpses from the bridges with poles and boat-hooks.</p>
<p>All this Tignonville saw, though his eyes, leaping the turmoil, looked
only to the door at which he had left Mademoiselle a few hours earlier.&nbsp;
There a crowd of men pressed and struggled; but from the spot where
he stood he could see no more.&nbsp; That was enough, however.&nbsp;
Rage nerved him, and despair; his world was dying round him.&nbsp; If
he could not save her he would avenge her.&nbsp; Recklessly he plunged
into the tumult; blade in hand, with vigorous blows he thrust his way
through, his white sleeve and the white cross in his hat gaining him
passage until he reached the fringe of the band who beset the door.&nbsp;
Here his first attempt to pass failed; and he might have remained hampered
by the crowd, if a squad of archers had not ridden up.&nbsp; As they
spurred to the spot, heedless over whom they rode, he clutched a stirrup,
and was borne with them into the heart of the crowd.&nbsp; In a twinkling
he stood on the threshold of the house, face to face and foot to foot
with Count Hannibal, who stood also on the threshold, but with his back
to the door, which, unbarred and unbolted, gaped open behind him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; ROUGH WOOING.</h2>
<p>The young man had caught the delirium that was abroad that night.&nbsp;
The rage of the trapped beast was in his heart, his hand held a sword.&nbsp;
To strike blindly, to strike without question the first who withstood
him was the wild-beast instinct; and if Count Hannibal had not spoken
on the instant, the Marshal&rsquo;s brother had said his last word in
the world.</p>
<p>Yet as he stood there, a head above the crowd, he seemed unconscious
alike of Tignonville and the point that all but pricked his breast.&nbsp;
Swart and grim-visaged, his harsh features distorted by the glare which
shone upon him, he looked beyond the Huguenot to the sea of tossing
arms and raging faces that surged about the saddles of the horsemen.&nbsp;
It was to these he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begone, dogs!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice that startled the
nearest, &ldquo;or I will whip you away with my stirrup-leathers!&nbsp;
Do you hear?&nbsp; Begone!&nbsp; This house is not for you!&nbsp; Burn,
kill, plunder where you will, but go hence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;tis on the list!&rdquo; one of the wretches yelled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis on the list!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pushed forward until
he stood at Tignonville&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has no cross!&rdquo; shrieked another, thrusting himself
forward in his turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;See you, let us by, whoever you are!&nbsp;
In the King&rsquo;s name, kill!&nbsp; It has no cross!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Tavannes thundered, &ldquo;will I nail you for
a cross to the front of it!&nbsp; No cross, say you?&nbsp; I will make
one of you, foul crow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he spoke, his arm shot out; the man recoiled, his fellow likewise.&nbsp;
But one of the mounted archers took up the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but, my lord,&rdquo; he said&mdash;he knew Tavannes&mdash;&ldquo;it
is the King&rsquo;s will there be no favour shown to-night to any, small
or great.&nbsp; And this house is registered, and is full of heretics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has no cross!&rdquo; the rabble urged in chorus.&nbsp;
And they leapt up and down in their impatience, and to see the better.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And has no cross!&rdquo; they persisted.&nbsp; They could understand
that.&nbsp; Of what use crosses, if they were not to kill where there
was no cross?&nbsp; Daylight was not plainer.&nbsp; Tavannes&rsquo;
face grew dark, and he shook his finger at the archer who had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogue,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;does the King&rsquo;s will
run here only?&nbsp; Are there no other houses to sack or men to kill,
that you must beard me?&nbsp; And favour?&nbsp; You will have little
of mine, if you do not budge and take your vile tail with you!&nbsp;
Off!&nbsp; Or must I cry &lsquo;Tavannes!&rsquo; and bid my people sweep
you from the streets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foremost rank hesitated, awed by his manner and his name; while
the rearmost, attracted by the prospect of easier pillage, had gone
off already.&nbsp; The rest wavered; and another and another broke away.&nbsp;
The archer who had put himself forward saw which way the wind was blowing,
and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lord, as you will,&rdquo; he said sullenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All the same I would advise you to close the door and bolt and
bar.&nbsp; We shall not be the last to call to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he turned his horse in ill-humour, and forced it, snorting and plunging,
through the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bolt and bar?&rdquo; Tavannes cried after him in fury.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See you my answer to that!&rdquo;&nbsp; And turning on the threshold,
&ldquo;Within there!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open the shutters
and set lights, and the table!&nbsp; Light, I say; light!&nbsp; And
lay on quickly, if you value your lives!&nbsp; And throw open, for I
sup with your mistress to-night, if it rain blood without!&nbsp; Do
you hear me, rogues?&nbsp; Set on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flung the last word at the quaking servants; then he turned again
to the street.&nbsp; He saw that the crowd was melting, and, looking
in Tignonville&rsquo;s face, he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Monsieur sup with us?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
complete the party?&nbsp; Or will he choose to sup with our friends
yonder?&nbsp; It is for him to say.&nbsp; I confess, for my part,&rdquo;
with an awful smile, &ldquo;their hospitality seems a trifle crude,
and boisterous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville looked behind him and shuddered.&nbsp; The same horde
which had so lately pressed about the door had found a victim lower
down the street, and, as Tavannes spoke, came driving back along the
roadway, a mass of tossing lights and leaping, running figures, from
the heart of which rose the screams of a creature in torture.&nbsp;
So terrible were the sounds that Tignonville leant half swooning against
the door-post; and even the iron heart of Tavannes seemed moved for
a moment.</p>
<p>For a moment only: then he looked at his companion, and his lip curled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll join us, I think?&rdquo; he said, with an undisguised
sneer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, after you, Monsieur.&nbsp; They are opening
the shutters.&nbsp; Doubtless the table is laid, and Mademoiselle is
expecting us.&nbsp; After you, Monsieur, if you please.&nbsp; A few
hours ago I should have gone first, for you, in this house&rdquo;&mdash;with
a sinister smile&mdash;&ldquo;were at home!&nbsp; Now, we have changed
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever he meant by the gibe&mdash;and some smack of an evil jest
lurked in his tone&mdash;he played the host so far as to urge his bewildered
companion along the passage and into the living-chamber on the left,
where he had seen from without that his orders to light and lay were
being executed.&nbsp; A dozen candles shone on the board, and lit up
the apartment.&nbsp; What the house contained of food and wine had been
got together and set on the table; from the low, wide window, beetle-browed
and diamond-paned, which extended the whole length of the room and looked
on the street at the height of a man&rsquo;s head above the roadway,
the shutters had been removed&mdash;doubtless by trembling and reluctant
fingers.&nbsp; To such eyes of passers-by as looked in, from the inferno
of driving crowds and gleaming weapons which prevailed outside&mdash;and
not outside only, but throughout Paris&mdash;the brilliant room and
the laid table must have seemed strange indeed!</p>
<p>To Tignonville, all that had happened, all that was happening, seemed
a dream: a dream his entrance under the gentle impulsion of this man
who dominated him; a dream Mademoiselle standing behind the table with
blanched face and stony eyes; a dream the cowering servants huddled
in a corner beyond her; a dream his silence, her silence, the moment
of waiting before Count Hannibal spoke.</p>
<p>When he did speak it was to count the servants.&nbsp; &ldquo;One,
two, three, four, five,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And two of them
women.&nbsp; Mademoiselle is but poorly attended.&nbsp; Are there not&rdquo;&mdash;and
he turned to her&mdash;&ldquo;some lacking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl opened her lips twice, but no sound issued.&nbsp; The third
time&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two went out,&rdquo; she muttered in a hoarse, strangled voice,
&ldquo;and have not returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have not returned?&rdquo; he answered, raising his eyebrows.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I fear we must not wait for them.&nbsp; We might wait long!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And turning sharply to the panic-stricken servants, &ldquo;Go you to
your places!&nbsp; Do you not see that Mademoiselle waits to be served?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shuddered and spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish me,&rdquo; she muttered, in the same strangled
tone, &ldquo;to play this farce&mdash;to the end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end may be better, Mademoiselle, than you think,&rdquo;
he answered, bowing.&nbsp; And then to the miserable servants, who hung
back afraid to leave the shelter of their mistress&rsquo;s skirts, &ldquo;To
your places!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Set Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
chair.&nbsp; Are you so remiss on other days?&nbsp; If so,&rdquo; with
a look of terrible meaning, &ldquo;you will be the less loss!&nbsp;
Now, Mademoiselle, may I have the honour?&nbsp; And when we are at table
we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He extended his hand, and, obedient to his gesture, she moved to
the place at the head of the table, but without letting her fingers
come into contact with his.&nbsp; He gave no sign that he noticed this,
but he strode to the place on her right, and signed to Tignonville to
take that on her left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not be seated?&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; For she
kept her feet.</p>
<p>She turned her head stiffly, until for the first time her eyes looked
into his.&nbsp; A shudder more violent than the last shook her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you not better&mdash;kill us at once?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
The blood had forsaken even her lips.&nbsp; Her face was the face of
a statue&mdash;white, beautiful, lifeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he said gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be seated,
and let us hope for the best.&nbsp; And you, sir,&rdquo; he continued,
turning to Carlat, &ldquo;serve your mistress with wine.&nbsp; She needs
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward filled for her, and then for each of the men, his shaking
hand spilling as much as it poured.&nbsp; Nor was this strange.&nbsp;
Above the din and uproar of the street, above the crash of distant doors,
above the tocsin that still rang from the reeling steeple of St. Germain&rsquo;s,
the great bell of the Palais on the island had just begun to hurl its
note of doom upon the town.&nbsp; A woman crouching at the end of the
chamber burst into hysterical weeping, but, at a glance from Tavannes&rsquo;
terrible eye, was mute again.</p>
<p>Tignonville found voice at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have they&mdash;killed
the Admiral?&rdquo; he muttered, his eyes on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Coligny?&nbsp; An hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Teligny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Rochefoucauld?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dealing with M. le Comte now, I believe,&rdquo; Tavannes
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had his chance and cast it away.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he began to eat.</p>
<p>The man at the table shuddered.&nbsp; The woman continued to look
before her, but her lips moved as if she prayed.&nbsp; Suddenly a rush
of feet, a roar of voices surged past the window; for a moment the glare
of the torches, which danced ruddily on the walls of the room, showed
a severed head borne above the multitude on a pike.&nbsp; Mademoiselle,
with a low cry, made an effort to rise, but Count Hannibal grasped her
wrist, and she sank back half fainting.&nbsp; Then the nearer clamour
sank a little, and the bells, unchallenged, flung their iron tongues
above the maddened city.&nbsp; In the east the dawn was growing; soon
its grey light would fall on cold hearths, on battered doors and shattered
weapons, on hordes of wretches drunk with greed and hate.</p>
<p>When he could be heard, &ldquo;What are you going to do with us?&rdquo;
the man asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; Count Hannibal replied, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Mademoiselle de Vrillac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with passion.&nbsp; He leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she to do with it?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; And he
stood up and sat down again in a breath.</p>
<p>Tavannes raised his eyebrows with a blandness that seemed at odds
with his harsh visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer that question by another question,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many are there in the house, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes counted again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seven?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
Tignonville nodded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Monsieur, you know the King&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can guess it,&rdquo; the other replied furiously.&nbsp;
And he cursed the King, and the King&rsquo;s mother, calling her Jezebel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can guess it?&rdquo; Tavannes answered; and then with
sudden heat, as if that which he had to say could not be said even by
him in cold blood, &ldquo;Nay, you know it!&nbsp; You heard it from
the archer at the door.&nbsp; You heard him say, &lsquo;No favour, no
quarter for man, for woman, or for child.&nbsp; So says the King.&rsquo;&nbsp;
You heard it, but you fence with me.&nbsp; Foucauld, with whom his Majesty
played to-night, hand to hand and face to face&mdash;Foucauld is dead!&nbsp;
And you think to live?&nbsp; You?&rdquo; he continued, lashing himself
into passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not by what chance you came where
I saw you an hour gone, nor by what chance you came by that and that&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
with accusing finger to the badges the Huguenot wore.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
this I know!&nbsp; I have but to cry your name from yonder casement,
nay, Monsieur, I have but to stand aside when the mob go their rounds
from house to house, as they will go presently, and you will perish
as certainly as you have hitherto escaped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the second time Mademoiselle turned and looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she whispered, with white lips, &ldquo;to what
end this&mdash;mockery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the end that seven lives may be saved, Mademoiselle,&rdquo;
he answered, bowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a price?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a price,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;A price which
women do not find it hard to pay&mdash;at Court.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis paid
every day for pleasure or a whim, for rank or the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>,
for robes and gewgaws.&nbsp; Few, Mademoiselle, are privileged to buy
a life; still fewer, seven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to tremble.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would rather die&mdash;seven
times!&rdquo; she cried, her voice quivering.&nbsp; And she tried to
rise, but sat down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these?&rdquo; he said, indicating the servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far, far rather!&rdquo; she repeated passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Monsieur?&nbsp; And Monsieur?&rdquo; he urged with stern
persistence, while his eyes passed lightly from her to Tignonville and
back to her again, their depths inscrutable.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you love
Monsieur, Mademoiselle, and I believe you do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can die with him!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She writhed in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he with you?&rdquo; Count Hannibal repeated, with emphasis;
and he thrust forward his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;For that is the question.&nbsp;
Think, think, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; It is in my power to save from death
him whom you love; to save you; to save this <i>canaille</i>, if it
so please you.&nbsp; It is in my power to save him, to save you, to
save all; and I will save all&mdash;at a price!&nbsp; If, on the other
hand, you deny me that price, I will as certainly leave all to perish,
as perish they will, before the sun that is now rising sets to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle looked straight before her, the flicker of a dreadful
prescience in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the price?&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you!&nbsp; Nay, why fence with me?&rdquo; he continued
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You knew it, you have said it.&nbsp; You have read
it in my eyes these seven days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not speak, or move, or seem to breathe.&nbsp; As he said,
she had foreseen, she had known the answer.&nbsp; But Tignonville, it
seemed, had not.&nbsp; He sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Tavannes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you are a villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a villain!&nbsp; But you shall pay for this!&rdquo;
the young man continued vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall not leave
this room alive!&nbsp; You shall pay for this insult!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insult?&rdquo; Tavannes answered in apparent surprise; and
then, as if comprehension broke upon him, &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur mistakes
me,&rdquo; he said, with a broad sweep of the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
Mademoiselle also, perhaps?&nbsp; Oh! be content, she shall have bell,
book, and candle; she shall be tied as tight as Holy Church can tie
her!&nbsp; Or, if she please, and one survive, she shall have a priest
of her own church&mdash;you call it a church?&nbsp; She shall have whichever
of the two will serve her better.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis one to me!&nbsp;
But for paying me, Monsieur,&rdquo; he continued, with irony in voice
and manner; &ldquo;when, I pray you?&nbsp; In Eternity?&nbsp; For if
you refuse my offer, you have done with time.&nbsp; Now?&nbsp; I have
but to sound this whistle&rdquo;&mdash;he touched a silver whistle which
hung at his breast&mdash;&ldquo;and there are those within hearing will
do your business before you make two passes.&nbsp; Dismiss the notion,
sir, and understand.&nbsp; You are in my power.&nbsp; Paris runs with
blood, as noble as yours, as innocent as hers.&nbsp; If you would not
perish with the rest, decide!&nbsp; And quickly!&nbsp; For what you
have seen are but the forerunners, what you have heard are but the gentle
whispers that predict the gale.&nbsp; Do not parley too long; so long
that even I may no longer save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather die!&rdquo; Mademoiselle moaned, her face covered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would rather die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see him die?&rdquo; he answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
see these die?&nbsp; Think, think, child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not do it!&rdquo; she gasped.&nbsp; She shook from
head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do nothing,&rdquo; he answered firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall but leave you to your fate, and these to theirs.&nbsp; In the
King&rsquo;s teeth I dare save my wife and her people; but no others.&nbsp;
You must choose&mdash;and quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the frightened women&mdash;it was Mademoiselle&rsquo;s tiring-maid,
a girl called Javette&mdash;made a movement, as if to throw herself
at her mistress&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Tignonville drove her to her place
with a word.&nbsp; He turned to Count Hannibal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must be mad!&nbsp;
Mad, to wish to marry her in this way!&nbsp; You do not love her.&nbsp;
You do not want her.&nbsp; What is she to you more than other women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she to you more than other women?&rdquo; Tavannes
retorted, in a tone so sharp and incisive that Tignonville started,
and a faint touch of colour crept into the wan cheek of the girl, who
sat between them, the prize of the contest.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is she
more to you than other women?&nbsp; Is she more?&nbsp; And yet&mdash;you
want her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is more to me,&rdquo; Tignonville answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; the other retorted, with a ring of keen meaning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is she?&nbsp; But we bandy words and the storm is rising, as
I warned you it would rise.&nbsp; Enough for you that I <i>do</i> want
her.&nbsp; Enough for you that I <i>will</i> have her.&nbsp; She shall
be the wife, the willing wife, of Hannibal de Tavannes&mdash;or I leave
her to her fate, and you to yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; she moaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The willing wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Mademoiselle, the willing wife,&rdquo; he answered sternly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or no man&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; WHO TOUCHES TAVANNES?</h2>
<p>In saying that the storm was rising Count Hannibal had said no more
than the truth.&nbsp; A new mob had a minute before burst from the eastward
into the Rue St. Honor&eacute;; and the roar of its thousand voices
swelled louder than the importunate clangour of the bells.&nbsp; Behind
its moving masses the dawn of a new day&mdash;Sunday, the 24th of August,
the feast of St. Bartholomew&mdash;was breaking over the Bastille, as
if to aid the crowd in its cruel work.&nbsp; The gabled streets, the
lanes, and gothic courts, the stifling wynds, where the work awaited
the workers, still lay in twilight; still the gleam of the torches,
falling on the house-fronts, heralded the coming of the crowd.&nbsp;
But the dawn was growing, the sun was about to rise.&nbsp; Soon the
day would be here, giving up the lurking fugitive whom darkness, more
pitiful, had spared, and stamping with legality the horrors that night
had striven to hide.</p>
<p>And with day, with the full light, killing would grow more easy,
escape more hard.&nbsp; Already they were killing on the bridge where
the rich goldsmiths lived, on the wharves, on the river.&nbsp; They
were killing at the Louvre, in the courtyard under the King&rsquo;s
eyes, and below the windows of the M&eacute;dicis.&nbsp; They were killing
in St. Martin and St. Denis and St. Antoine; wherever hate, or bigotry,
or private malice impelled the hand.&nbsp; From the whole city went
up a din of lamentation, and wrath, and foreboding.&nbsp; From the Cour
des Miracles, from the markets, from the Boucherie, from every haunt
of crime and misery, hordes of wretched creatures poured forth; some
to rob on their own account, and where they listed, none gainsaying;
more to join themselves to one of the armed bands whose business it
was to go from street to street, and house to house, quelling resistance,
and executing through Paris the high justice of the King.</p>
<p>It was one of these swollen bands which had entered the street while
Tavannes spoke; nor could he have called to his aid a more powerful
advocate.&nbsp; As the deep &ldquo;A bas!&nbsp; A bas!&rdquo; rolled
like thunder along the fronts of the houses, as the more strident &ldquo;Tuez!&nbsp;
Tuez!&rdquo; drew nearer and nearer, and the lights of the oncoming
multitude began to flicker on the shuttered gables, the fortitude of
the servants gave way.&nbsp; Madame Carlat, shivering in every limb,
burst into moaning; the tiring-maid, Javette, flung herself in terror
at Mademoiselle&rsquo;s knees, and, writhing herself about them, shrieked
to her to save her, only to save her!&nbsp; One of the men moved forward
on impulse, as if he would close the shutters; and only old Carlat remained
silent, praying mutely with moving lips and a stern, set face.</p>
<p>And Count Hannibal?&nbsp; As the glare of the links in the street
grew brighter, and ousted the sickly daylight, his form seemed to dilate.&nbsp;
He stilled the shrieking woman by a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choose! Mademoiselle, and quickly!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
I can only save my wife and her people!&nbsp; Quick, for the pinch is
coming, and &rsquo;twill be no boy&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shot, a scream from the street, a rush of racing feet before the
window seconded his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Mademoiselle!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; And his breath
came a little faster.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quick, before it be too late!&nbsp;
Will you save life, or will you kill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her lover with eyes of agony, dumbly questioning him.&nbsp;
But he made no sign, and only Tavannes marked the look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur has done what he can to save himself,&rdquo; he said,
with a sneer.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has donned the livery of the King&rsquo;s
servants; he has said, &lsquo;Whoever perishes, I will live!&rsquo;&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; the young man cried, and, stung to madness,
he tore the cross from his cap and flung it on the ground.&nbsp; He
seized his white sleeve and ripped it from shoulder to elbow.&nbsp;
Then, when it hung by the string only, he held his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he cried furiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
not at your bidding!&nbsp; I may save her yet!&nbsp; I <i>will</i> save
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Tavannes answered&mdash;but his words were barely
audible above the deafening uproar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you fight a thousand?&nbsp;
Look!&nbsp; Look!&rdquo; and seizing the other&rsquo;s wrist he pointed
to the window.</p>
<p>The street glowed like a furnace in the red light of torches, raised
on poles above a sea of heads; an endless sea of heads, and gaping faces,
and tossing arms which swept on and on, and on and by.&nbsp; For a while
it seemed that the torrent would flow past them and would leave them
safe.&nbsp; Then came a check, a confused outcry, a surging this way
and that; the torches reeled to and fro, and finally, with a dull roar
of &ldquo;Open!&nbsp; Open!&rdquo; the mob faced about to the house
and the lighted window.</p>
<p>For a second it seemed that even Count Hannibal&rsquo;s iron nerves
shook a little.&nbsp; He stood between the sullen group that surrounded
the disordered table and the maddened rabble, that gloated on the victims
before they tore them to pieces.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open!&nbsp; Open!&rdquo;
the mob howled: and a man dashed in the window with his pike.</p>
<p>In that crisis Mademoiselle&rsquo;s eyes met Tavannes&rsquo; for
the fraction of a second.&nbsp; She did not speak; nor, had she retained
the power to frame the words, would they have been audible.&nbsp; But
something she must have looked, and something of import, though no other
than he marked or understood it.&nbsp; For in a flash he was at the
window and his hand was raised for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; he thundered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Back, knaves!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he whistled shrilly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do what you will,&rdquo; he went
on in the same tone, &ldquo;but not here!&nbsp; Pass on!&nbsp; Pass
on!&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the crowd were not to be lightly diverted.&nbsp; With a persistence
brutal and unquestioning they continued to howl, &ldquo;Open!&nbsp;
Open!&rdquo; while the man who had broken the window the moment before,
Jehan, the cripple with the hideous face, seized the lead-work, and
tore away a great piece of it.&nbsp; Then, laying hold of a bar, he
tried to drag it out, setting one foot against the wall below.&nbsp;
Tavannes saw what he did, and his frame seemed to dilate with the fury
and violence of his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;must I call out my riders
and scatter you?&nbsp; Must I flog you through the streets with stirrup-leathers?&nbsp;
I am Tavannes; beware of me!&nbsp; I have claws and teeth and I bite!&rdquo;
he continued, the scorn in his words exceeding even the rage of the
crowd, at which he flung them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kill where you please, rob
where you please, but not where I am!&nbsp; Or I will hang you by the
heels on Montfaucon, man by man!&nbsp; I will flay your backs.&nbsp;
Go!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; I am Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the mob, cowed for a moment by the thunder of his voice, by his
arrogance and recklessness, showed at this that their patience was exhausted.&nbsp;
With a yell which drowned his tones they swayed forward; a dozen thundered
on the door, crying, &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;&nbsp; As
many more tore out the remainder of the casement, seized the bars of
the window, and strove to pull them out or to climb between them.&nbsp;
Jehan, the cripple, with whom Tignonville had rubbed elbows at the rendezvous,
led the way.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal watched them a moment, his harsh face bent down to
them, his features plain in the glare of the torches.&nbsp; But when
the cripple, raised on the others&rsquo; shoulders, and emboldened by
his adversary&rsquo;s inactivity, began to squeeze himself through the
bars, Tavannes raised a pistol, which he had held unseen behind him,
cocked it at leisure, and levelled it at the foul face which leered
close to his.&nbsp; The dwarf saw the weapon and tried to retreat; but
it was too late.&nbsp; A flash, a scream, and the wretch, shot through
the throat, flung up his hands, and fell back into the arms of a lean
man in black who had lent him his shoulder to ascend.</p>
<p>For a few seconds the smoke of the pistol filled the window and the
room.&nbsp; There was a cry that the Huguenots were escaping, that the
Huguenots were resisting, that it was a plot; and some shouted to guard
the back and some to watch the roof, and some to be gone.&nbsp; But
when the fumes cleared away, the mob saw, with stupor, that all was
as it had been.&nbsp; Count Hannibal stood where he had stood before,
a grim smile on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who comes next?&rdquo; he cried in a tone of mockery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have more pistols!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then with a sudden change
to ferocity, &ldquo;You dogs!&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You scum
of a filthy city, sweepings of the Halles!&nbsp; Do you think to beard
me?&nbsp; Do you think to frighten me or murder me?&nbsp; I am Tavannes,
and this is my house, and were there a score of Huguenots in it, you
should not touch one, nor harm a hair of his head!&nbsp; Begone, I say
again, while you may!&nbsp; Seek women and children, and kill them.&nbsp;
But not here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant the mingled scorn and brutality of his words silenced
them.&nbsp; Then from the rear of the crowd came an answer&mdash;the
roar of an arquebuse.&nbsp; The ball whizzed past Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
head, and, splashing the plaster from the wall within a pace of Tignonville,
dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>Tavannes laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bungler!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were
you in my troop I would dip your trigger-finger in boiling oil to teach
you to shoot!&nbsp; But you weary me, dogs.&nbsp; I must teach you a
lesson, must I?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he lifted a pistol and levelled it.&nbsp;
The crowd did not know whether it was the one he had discharged or another,
but they gave back with a sharp gasp.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must teach you,
must I?&rdquo; he continued with scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, Bigot, Badelon,
drive me these blusterers!&nbsp; Rid the street of them!&nbsp; A Tavannes!&nbsp;
A Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not by word or look had he before this betrayed that he had supports.&nbsp;
But as he cried the name, a dozen men armed to the teeth, who had stood
motionless under the Croix du Tiroir, fell in a line on the right flank
of the crowd.&nbsp; The surprise for those nearest them was complete.&nbsp;
With the flash of the pikes before their eyes, with the cold steel in
fancy between their ribs, they fled every way, uncertain how many pursued,
or if any pursuit there was.&nbsp; For a moment the mob, which a few
minutes before had seemed so formidable that a regiment might have quailed
before it, bade fair to be routed by a dozen pikes.</p>
<p>And so, had all in the crowd been what he termed them, the rabble
and sweepings of the streets, it would have been.&nbsp; But in the heart
of it, and felt rather than seen, were a handful of another kidney;
Sorbonne students and fierce-eyed priests, with three or four mounted
archers, the nucleus that, moving through the streets, had drawn together
this concourse.&nbsp; And these with threats and curse and gleaming
eyes stood fast, even Tavannes&rsquo; dare-devils recoiling before the
tonsure.&nbsp; The check thus caused allowed those who had budged a
breathing space.&nbsp; They rallied behind the black robes, and began
to stone the pikes; who in their turn withdrew until they formed two
groups, standing on their defence, the one before the window, the other
before the door.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal had watched the attack and the check, as a man watches
a play; with smiling interest.&nbsp; In the panic, the torches had been
dropped or extinguished, and now between the house and the sullen crowd
which hung back, yet grew moment by moment more dangerous, the daylight
fell cold on the littered street and the cripple&rsquo;s huddled form
prone in the gutter.&nbsp; A priest raised on the shoulders of the lean
man in black began to harangue the mob, and the dull roar of assent,
the brandished arms which greeted his appeal, had their effect on Tavannes&rsquo;
men.&nbsp; They looked to the window, and muttered among themselves.&nbsp;
It was plain that they had no stomach for a fight with the Church, and
were anxious for the order to withdraw.</p>
<p>But Count Hannibal gave no order, and, much as his people feared
the cowls, they feared him more.&nbsp; Meanwhile the speaker&rsquo;s
eloquence rose higher; he pointed with frenzied gestures to the house.&nbsp;
The mob groaned, and suddenly a volley of stones fell among the pikemen,
whose corselets rattled under the shower.&nbsp; The priest seized that
moment.&nbsp; He sprang to the ground, and to the front.&nbsp; He caught
up his robe and waved his hand, and the rabble, as if impelled by a
single will, rolled forward in a huge one-fronted thundering wave, before
which the two handfuls of pikemen&mdash;afraid to strike, yet afraid
to fly&mdash;were swept away like straws upon the tide.</p>
<p>But against the solid walls and oak-barred door of the house the
wave beat, only to fall back again, a broken, seething mass of brandished
arms and ravening faces.&nbsp; One point alone was vulnerable, the window,
and there in the gap stood Tavannes.&nbsp; Quick as thought he fired
two pistols into the crowd; then, while the smoke for a moment hid all,
he whistled.</p>
<p>Whether the signal was a summons to his men to fight their way back&mdash;as
they were doing to the best of their power&mdash;or he had resources
still unseen, was not to be known.&nbsp; For as the smoke began to rise,
and while the rabble before the window, cowed by the fall of two of
their number, were still pushing backward instead of forward, there
rose behind them strange sounds&mdash;yells, and the clatter of hoofs,
mingled with screams of alarm.&nbsp; A second, and into the loose skirts
of the crowd came charging helter-skelter, pell-mell, a score of galloping,
shrieking, cursing horsemen, attended by twice as many footmen, who
clung to their stirrups or to the tails of the horses, and yelled and
whooped, and struck in unison with the maddened riders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On! on!&rdquo; the foremost shrieked, rolling in his saddle,
and foaming at the mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bleed in August, bleed in May!&nbsp;
Kill!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he fired a pistol among the rabble, who fled
every way to escape his rearing, plunging charger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill! Kill!&rdquo; cried his followers, cutting the air with
their swords, and rolling to and fro on their horses in drunken emulation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bleed in August, bleed in May!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On!&nbsp; On!&rdquo; cried the leader, as the crowd which
beset the house fled every way before his reckless onset.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bleed
in August, bleed in May!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rabble fled, but not so quickly but that one or two were ridden
down, and this for an instant checked the riders.&nbsp; Before they
could pass on&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&eacute;!&rdquo; cried Count Hannibal from his window.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh&eacute;!&rdquo; with a shout of laughter, &ldquo;ride over
them, dear brother!&nbsp; Make me a clean street for my wedding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marshal Tavannes&mdash;for he, the hero of Jarnac, was the leader
of this wild orgy&mdash;turned that way, and strove to rein in his horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails them?&rdquo; he cried, as the maddened animal reared
upright, its iron hoofs striking fire from the slippery pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are rearing like thy Bayard!&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whip them, whip them for me!&nbsp; Tavannes!&nbsp; Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&nbsp; This canaille?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that canaille!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who touches my brother, touches Tavannes!&rdquo; the Marshal
replied, and spurred his horse among the rabble, who had fled to the
sides of the street and now strove hard to efface themselves against
the walls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begone, dogs; begone!&rdquo; he cried, still
hunting them.&nbsp; And then, &ldquo;You would bite, would you?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And snatching another pistol from his boot, he fired it among them,
careless whom he hit.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha! ha!&nbsp; That stirs you, does
it!&rdquo; he continued, as the wretches fled headlong.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
touches my brother, touches Tavannes!&nbsp; On!&nbsp; On!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, from a doorway near at hand, a sombre figure darted into
the roadway, caught the Marshal&rsquo;s rein, and for a second checked
his course.&nbsp; The priest&mdash;for a priest it was, Father Pezelay,
the same who had addressed the mob&mdash;held up a warning hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he cried, with burning eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halt,
my lord!&nbsp; It is written, thou shalt not spare the Canaanitish woman.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis not to spare the King has given command and a sword, but
to kill!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not to harbour, but to smite!&nbsp; To smite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then smite I will!&rdquo; the Marshal retorted, and with the
butt of his pistol struck the zealot down.&nbsp; Then, with as much
indifference as he would have treated a Huguenot, he spurred his horse
over him, with a mad laugh at his jest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who touches my
brother, touches Tavannes!&rdquo; he yelled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Touches Tavannes!&nbsp;
On!&nbsp; On!&nbsp; Bleed in August, bleed in May!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On!&rdquo; shouted his followers, striking about them in the
same desperate fashion.&nbsp; They were young nobles who had spent the
night feasting at the Palace, and, drunk with wine and mad with excitement,
had left the Louvre at daybreak to rouse the city.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Jarnac!&nbsp;
A Jarnac!&rdquo; they cried, and some saluted Count Hannibal as they
passed.&nbsp; And so, shouting and spurring and following their leader,
they swept away down the now empty street, carrying terror and a flame
wherever their horses bore them that morning.</p>
<p>Tavannes, his hands on the ledge of the shattered window, leaned
out laughing, and followed them with his eyes.&nbsp; A moment, and the
mob was gone, the street was empty; and one by one, with sheepish faces,
his pikemen emerged from the doorways and alleys in which they had taken
refuge.&nbsp; They gathered about the three huddled forms which lay
prone and still in the gutter: or, not three&mdash;two.&nbsp; For even
as they approached them, one, the priest, rose slowly and giddily to
his feet.&nbsp; He turned a face bleeding, lean, and relentless towards
the window at which Tavannes stood.&nbsp; Solemnly, with the sign of
the cross, and with uplifted hands, he cursed him in bed and at board,
by day and by night, in walking, in riding, in standing, in the day
of battle, and at the hour of death.&nbsp; The pikemen fell back appalled,
and hid their eyes; and those who were of the north crossed themselves,
and those who came from the south bent two fingers horse-shoe fashion.&nbsp;
But Hannibal de Tavannes laughed; laughed in his moustache, his teeth
showing, and bade them move that carrion to a distance, for it would
smell when the sun was high.&nbsp; Then he turned his back on the street,
and looked into the room.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; IN THE AMPHITHEATRE.</h2>
<p>The movements of the women had overturned two of the candles; a third
had guttered out.&nbsp; The three which still burned, contending pallidly
with the daylight that each moment grew stronger, imparted to the scene
the air of a debauch too long sustained.&nbsp; The disordered board,
the wan faces of the servants cowering in their corner, Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
frozen look of misery, all increased the likeness; which a common exhaustion
so far strengthened that when Tavannes turned from the window, and,
flushed with his triumph, met the others&rsquo; eyes, his seemed the
only vigour, and he the only man in the company.&nbsp; True, beneath
the exhaustion, beneath the collapse of his victims, there burned passions,
hatreds, repulsions, as fierce as the hidden fires of the volcano; but
for the time they smouldered ash-choked and inert.</p>
<p>He flung the discharged pistols on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;If yonder
raven speak truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am like to pay dearly for
my wife, and have short time to call her wife.&nbsp; The more need,
Mademoiselle, for speed, therefore.&nbsp; You know the old saying, &lsquo;Short
signing, long seisin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Shall it be my priest, or your minister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville started forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;She promised nothing!&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; And he struck his hand on the table.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal smiled, his lip curling.&nbsp; &ldquo;That,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;is for Mademoiselle to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she says it?&nbsp; If she says it, Monsieur?&nbsp;
What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes drew forth a comfit-box, such as it was the fashion of the
day to carry, as men of a later time carried a snuff-box.&nbsp; He slowly
chose a prune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she says it?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then M. de
Tignonville has regained his sweetheart.&nbsp; And M. de Tavannes has
lost his bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she will not say it,&rdquo; Tavannes replied coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, why not?&rdquo; the younger man repeated, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, M. de Tignonville, it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she did not speak!&rdquo; Tignonville retorted, with passion&mdash;the
futile passion of the bird which beats its wings against a cage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She did not speak.&nbsp; She could not promise, therefore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes ate the prune slowly, seemed to give a little thought to
its flavour, approved it a true Agen plum, and at last spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for you to say whether she promised,&rdquo; he returned
dryly, &ldquo;nor for me.&nbsp; It is for Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave it to her to say whether she promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must say No!&rdquo; Tignonville cried in a tone of
triumph and relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;For she did not speak.&nbsp; Mademoiselle,
listen!&rdquo; he continued, turning with outstretched hands and appealing
to her with passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you hear?&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp;
You have but to speak to be free!&nbsp; You have but to say the word,
and Monsieur lets you go!&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s name, speak!&nbsp; Speak
then, Clotilde!&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; with a gesture of despair, as she did
not answer, but continued to sit stony and hopeless, looking straight
before her, her hands picking convulsively at the fringe of her girdle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She does not understand!&nbsp; Fright has stunned her!&nbsp;
Be merciful, Monsieur.&nbsp; Give her time to recover, to know what
she does.&nbsp; Fright has turned her brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew her father and her uncle,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and in their time the Vrillacs were not wont to be cowards.&nbsp;
Monsieur forgets, too,&rdquo; he continued with fine irony, &ldquo;that
he speaks of my betrothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes raised his eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in my power,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the rest, if it be a lie, Mademoiselle has
but to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear him?&rdquo; Tignonville cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
speak, Mademoiselle!&nbsp; Clotilde, speak!&nbsp; Say you never spoke,
you never promised him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s voice quivered with indignation, with rage,
with pain; but most, if the truth be told, with shame&mdash;the shame
of a position strange and unparalleled. For in proportion as the fear
of death instant and violent was lifted from him, reflection awoke,
and the situation in which he stood took uglier shape.&nbsp; It was
not so much love that cried to her, love that suffered, anguished by
the prospect of love lost; as in the highest natures it might have been.&nbsp;
Rather it was the man&rsquo;s pride which suffered: the pride of a high
spirit which found itself helpless between the hammer and the anvil,
in a position so false that hereafter men might say of the unfortunate
that he had bartered his mistress for his life.&nbsp; He had not!&nbsp;
But he had perforce to stand by; he had to be passive under stress of
circumstances, and by the sacrifice, if she consummated it, he would
in fact be saved.</p>
<p>There was the pinch.&nbsp; No wonder that he cried to her in a voice
which roused even the servants from their lethargy of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say it, before it be
too late.&nbsp; Say, you did not promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly she turned her face to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo;
she whispered; &ldquo;I cannot.&nbsp; Go,&rdquo; she continued, a spasm
distorting her features.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, Monsieur.&nbsp; Leave me.&nbsp;
It is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You promised him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the young man cried, in a transport of resentment,
&ldquo;I will be no part of the price.&nbsp; See!&nbsp; There!&nbsp;
And there!&rdquo;&nbsp; He tore the white sleeve wholly from his arm,
and, rending it in twain, flung it on the floor and trampled on it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It shall never be said that I stood by and let you buy my life!&nbsp;
I go into the street and I take my chance.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned
to the door.</p>
<p>But Tavannes was before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you
will stay here, M. de Tignonville!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he set his back
against the door.</p>
<p>The young man looked at him, his face convulsed with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay here?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why,
Monsieur?&nbsp; What is it to you if I choose to perish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this,&rdquo; Tavannes retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am answerable
to Mademoiselle now, in an hour I shall be answerable to my wife&mdash;for
your life.&nbsp; Live, then, Monsieur; you have no choice.&nbsp; In
a month you will thank me&mdash;and her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must stay here&mdash;to be tortured?&rdquo; Tignonville
cried.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.&nbsp; Sudden stormy changes,
from indifference to ferocity, from irony to invective, were characteristic
of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tortured!&rdquo; he repeated grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You talk
of torture while Piles and Pardaillan, Teligny and Rochefoucauld lie
dead in the street!&nbsp; While your cause sinks withered in a night,
like a gourd!&nbsp; While your servants fall butchered, and France rises
round you in a tide of blood!&nbsp; Bah!&rdquo;&mdash;with a gesture
of disdain&mdash;&ldquo;you make me also talk, and I have no love for
talk, and small time.&nbsp; Mademoiselle, you at least act and do not
talk.&nbsp; By your leave I return in an hour, and I bring with me&mdash;shall
it be my priest, or your minister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with the face of one who awakes slowly to the full
horror, the full dread, of her position.&nbsp; For a moment she did
not answer.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister,&rdquo; she muttered, her voice scarcely audible.</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;A minister,&rdquo; he said lightly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well, if I can find one.&rdquo;&nbsp; And walking to the
shattered, gaping casement&mdash;through which the cool morning air
blew into the room and gently stirred the hair of the unhappy girl&mdash;he
said some words to the man on guard outside.&nbsp; Then he turned to
the door, but on the threshold he paused, looked with a strange expression
at the pair, and signed to Carlat and the servants to go out before
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, and lie close above!&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open
a window or look out, and you will pay dearly for it!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp;
Up!&nbsp; Up!&nbsp; You, too, old crop-ears.&nbsp; What! would you?&rdquo;&mdash;with
a sudden glare as Carlat hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;that is better!&nbsp;
Mademoiselle, until my return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw them all out, followed them, and closed the door on the two;
who, left together, alone with the gaping window and the disordered
feast, maintained a strange silence.&nbsp; The girl, gripping one hand
in the other as if to quell her rising horror, sat looking before her,
and seemed barely to breathe.&nbsp; The man, leaning against the wall
at a little distance, bent his eyes, not on her, but on the floor, his
face gloomy and distorted.</p>
<p>His first thought should have been of her and for her; his first
impulse to console, if he could not save her.&nbsp; His it should have
been to soften, were that possible, the fate before her; to prove to
her by words of farewell, the purest and most sacred, that the sacrifice
she was making, not to save her own life but the lives of others, was
appreciated by him who paid with her the price.</p>
<p>And all these things, and more, may have been in M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s
mind; they may even have been uppermost in it, but they found no expression.&nbsp;
The man remained sunk in a sombre reverie.&nbsp; He had the appearance
of thinking of himself, not of her; of his own position, not of hers.&nbsp;
Otherwise he must have looked at her, he must have turned to her; he
must have owned the subtle attraction of her unspoken appeal when she
drew a deep breath and slowly turned her eyes on him, mute, asking,
waiting what he should offer.</p>
<p>Surely he should have!&nbsp; Yet it was long before he responded.&nbsp;
He sat buried in thought of himself, and his position, the vile, the
unworthy position in which her act had placed him.&nbsp; At length the
constraint of her gaze wrought on him, or his thoughts became unbearable;
and he looked up and met her eyes, and with an oath he sprang to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not be!&rdquo; he cried, in a tone low, but full
of fury.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall not do it!&nbsp; I will kill him first!&nbsp;
I will kill him with this hand!&nbsp; Or&mdash;&rdquo; a step took him
to the window, a step brought him back&mdash;ay, brought him back exultant,
and with a changed face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or better, we will thwart him
yet.&nbsp; See, Mademoiselle, do you see?&nbsp; Heaven is merciful!&nbsp;
For a moment the cage is open!&rdquo;&nbsp; His eye shone with excitement,
the sweat of sudden hope stood on his brow as he pointed to the unguarded
casement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come! it is our one chance!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he caught her by her arm and strove to draw her to the window.</p>
<p>But she hung back, staring at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! I say!&rdquo; he responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do
not understand.&nbsp; The way is open!&nbsp; We can escape, Clotilde,
we can escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot!&nbsp; I cannot!&rdquo; she wailed, still resisting
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo; she repeated the word in a tone of wonder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, but I cannot.&nbsp; I promised him.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp;
And, O God!&rdquo; she continued, in a sudden outburst of grief, as
the sense of general loss, of the great common tragedy broke on her
and whelmed for the moment her private misery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should
we think of ourselves?&nbsp; They are dead, they are dying, who were
ours, whom we loved!&nbsp; Why should we think to live?&nbsp; What does
it matter how it fares with us?&nbsp; We cannot be happy.&nbsp; Happy?&rdquo;
she continued wildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are any happy now?&nbsp; Or is the
world all changed in a night?&nbsp; No, we could not be happy.&nbsp;
And at least you will live, Tignonville.&nbsp; I have that to console
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live!&rdquo; he responded vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I live?&nbsp;
I would rather die a thousand times.&nbsp; A thousand times rather than
live shamed!&nbsp; Than see you sacrificed to that devil!&nbsp; Than
go out with a brand on my brow, for every man to point at me!&nbsp;
I would rather die a thousand times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think that I would not?&rdquo; she answered, shivering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better, far better die than&mdash;than live with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him, wide-eyed, and a sudden stillness possessed her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How?&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; As he spoke, he raised his hand
and signed to her to listen.&nbsp; A sullen murmur, distant as yet,
but borne to the ear on the fresh morning air, foretold the rising of
another storm.&nbsp; The sound grew in intensity, even while she listened;
and yet for a moment she misunderstood him.&nbsp; &ldquo;O God!&rdquo;
she cried, out of the agony of nerves overwrought, &ldquo;will that
bell never stop?&nbsp; Will it never stop?&nbsp; Will no one stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not the bell!&rdquo; he cried, seizing her hand
as if to focus her attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the mob you hear.&nbsp;
They are returning.&nbsp; We have but to stand a moment at this open
window, we have but to show ourselves to them, and we need live no longer!&nbsp;
Mademoiselle!&nbsp; Clotilde!&mdash;if you mean what you say, if you
are in earnest, the way is open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall die&mdash;together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, together.&nbsp; But have you the courage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The courage?&rdquo; she cried, a brave smile lighting the
whiteness of her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The courage were needed to live.&nbsp;
The courage were needed to do that.&nbsp; I am ready, quite ready.&nbsp;
It can be no sin!&nbsp; To live with that in front of me were the sin!&nbsp;
Come!&rdquo;&nbsp; For the moment she had forgotten her people, her
promise, all!&nbsp; It seemed to her that death would absolve her from
all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved with her under the impulse of her hand until they stood
at the gaping window.&nbsp; The murmur, which he had heard indistinctly
a moment before, had grown to a roar of voices.&nbsp; The mob, on its
return eastward along the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, was nearing the house.&nbsp;
He stood, his arm supporting her, and they waited, a little within the
window.&nbsp; Suddenly he stooped, his face hardly less white than hers:
their eyes met; he would have kissed her.</p>
<p>She did not withdraw from his arm, but she drew back her face, her
eyes half shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&nbsp; While I live
I am his.&nbsp; But we die together, Tignonville!&nbsp; We die together.&nbsp;
It will not last long, will it?&nbsp; And afterwards&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence, but her lips moved in prayer, and
over her features came a far-away look; such a look as that which on
the face of another Huguenot lady, Philippa de Luns&mdash;vilely done
to death in the Place Maubert fourteen years before&mdash;silenced the
ribald jests of the lowest rabble in the world.&nbsp; An hour or two
earlier, awed by the abruptness of the outburst, Mademoiselle had shrunk
from her fate; she had known fear.&nbsp; Now that she stood out voluntarily
to meet it, she, like many a woman before and since, feared no longer.&nbsp;
She was lifted out of and above herself.</p>
<p>But death was long in coming.&nbsp; Some cause beyond their knowledge
stayed the onrush of the mob along the street.&nbsp; The din, indeed,
persisted, deafened, shook them; but the crowd seemed to be at a stand
a few doors down the Rue St. Honor&eacute;.&nbsp; For a half-minute,
a long half-minute, which appeared an age, it drew no nearer.&nbsp;
Would it draw nearer?&nbsp; Would it come on?&nbsp; Or would it turn
again?</p>
<p>The doubt, so much worse than despair, began to sap that courage
of the man which is always better fitted to do than to suffer.&nbsp;
The sweat rose on Tignonville&rsquo;s brow as he stood listening, his
arm round the girl&mdash;as he stood listening and waiting.&nbsp; It
is possible that when he had said a minute or two earlier that he would
rather die a thousand times than live thus shamed, he had spoken beyond
the mark.&nbsp; Or it is possible that he had meant his words to the
full.&nbsp; But in this case he had not pictured what was to come, he
had not gauged correctly his power of passive endurance.&nbsp; He was
as brave as the ordinary man, as the ordinary soldier; but martyrdom,
the apotheosis of resignation, comes more naturally to women than to
men, more hardly to men than to women.&nbsp; Yet had the crisis come
quickly he might have met it.&nbsp; But he had to wait, and to wait
with that howling of wild beasts in his ears; and for this he was not
prepared.&nbsp; A woman might be content to die after this fashion;
but a man?&nbsp; His colour went and came, his eyes began to rove hither
and thither.&nbsp; Was it even now too late to escape?&nbsp; Too late
to avoid the consequences of the girl&rsquo;s silly persistence?&nbsp;
Too late to&mdash;?&nbsp; Her eyes were closed, she hung half lifeless
on his arm.&nbsp; She would not know, she need not know until afterwards.&nbsp;
And afterwards she would thank him!&nbsp; Afterwards&mdash;meantime
the window was open, the street was empty, and still the crowd hung
back and did not come.</p>
<p>He remembered that two doors away was a narrow passage, which leaving
the Rue St. Honor&eacute; turned at right angles under a beetling archway,
to emerge in the Rue du Roule.&nbsp; If he could gain that passage unseen
by the mob!&nbsp; He <i>would</i> gain it.&nbsp; With a swift movement,
his mind made up, he took a step forward.&nbsp; He tightened his grasp
of the girl&rsquo;s waist, and, seizing with his left hand the end of
the bar which the assailants had torn from its setting in the window
jamb, he turned to lower himself.&nbsp; One long step would land him
in the street.</p>
<p>At that moment she awoke from the stupor of exaltation.&nbsp; She
opened her eyes with a startled movement; and her eyes met his.</p>
<p>He was in the act of stepping backwards and downwards, dragging her
after him.&nbsp; But it was not this betrayed him.&nbsp; It was his
face, which in an instant told her all, and that he sought not death,
but life!&nbsp; She struggled upright and strove to free herself.&nbsp;
But he had the purchase of the bar, and by this time he was furious
as well as determined.&nbsp; Whether she would or no, he would save
her, he would drag her out.&nbsp; Then, as consciousness fully returned,
she, too, took fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; and she struggled
more violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall!&rdquo; he retorted between his teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
shall not perish here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she had her hands free, and as he spoke she thrust him from her
passionately, desperately, with all her strength.&nbsp; He had his one
foot in the air at the moment, and in a flash it was done.&nbsp; With
a cry of rage he lost his balance, and, still holding the bar, reeled
backwards through the window; while Mademoiselle, panting and half fainting,
recoiled&mdash;recoiled into the arms of Hannibal de Tavannes, who,
unseen by either, had entered the room a long minute before.&nbsp; From
the threshold, and with a smile, all his own, he had watched the contest
and the result.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; TWO HENS AND AN EGG.</h2>
<p>M. de Tignonville was shaken by the fall, and in the usual course
of things he would have lain where he was, and groaned.&nbsp; But when
a man has once turned his back on death he is apt to fancy it at his
shoulder.&nbsp; He has small stomach for surprises, and is in haste
to set as great a distance as possible between the ugly thing and himself.&nbsp;
So it was with the Huguenot.&nbsp; Shot suddenly into the full publicity
of the street, he knew that at any instant danger might take him by
the nape; and he was on his legs and glancing up and down before the
clatter of his fall had travelled the length of three houses.</p>
<p>The rabble were still a hundred paces away, piled up and pressed
about a house where men were being hunted as men hunt rats.&nbsp; He
saw that he was unnoted, and apprehension gave place to rage.&nbsp;
His thoughts turned back hissing hot to the thing that had happened,
and in a paroxysm of shame he shook his fist at the gaping casement
and the sneering face of his rival, dimly seen in the background.&nbsp;
If a look would have killed Tavannes&mdash;and her&mdash;it had not
been wanting.</p>
<p>For it was not only the man M. de Tignonville hated at this moment;
he hated Mademoiselle also, the unwitting agent of the other&rsquo;s
triumph.&nbsp; She had thrust him from her; she had refused to be guided
by him; she had resisted, thwarted, shamed him.&nbsp; Then let her take
the consequences.&nbsp; She willed to perish: let her perish!</p>
<p>He did not acknowledge even to himself the real cause of offence,
the proof to which she had put his courage, and the failure of that
courage to stand the test.&nbsp; Yet it was this, though he had himself
provoked the trial, which burned up his chivalry, as the smuggler&rsquo;s
fire burns up the dwarf heath upon the Landes.&nbsp; It was the discovery
that in an heroic hour he was no hero that gave force to his passionate
gesture, and next moment sent him storming down the beetling passage
to the Rue du Roule, his heart a maelstrom of fierce vows and fiercer
menaces.</p>
<p>He had reached the further end of the alley and was on the point
of entering the street before he remembered that he had nowhere to go.&nbsp;
His lodgings were no longer his, since his landlord knew him to be a
Huguenot, and would doubtless betray him.&nbsp; To approach those of
his faith whom he had frequented was to expose them to danger; and,
beyond the religion, he had few acquaintances and those of the newest.&nbsp;
Yet the streets were impossible.&nbsp; He walked them on the utmost
edge of peril; he lurked in them under the blade of an impending axe.&nbsp;
And, whether he walked or lurked, he went at the mercy of the first
comers bold enough to take his life.</p>
<p>The sweat stood on his brow as he paused under the low arch of the
alley-end, tasting the bitter forlornness of the dog banned and set
for death in that sunlit city.&nbsp; In every window of the gable end
which faced his hiding-place he fancied an eye watching his movements;
in every distant step he heard the footfall of doom coming that way
to his discovery.&nbsp; And while he trembled, he had to reflect, to
think, to form some plan.</p>
<p>In the town was no place for him, and short of the open country no
safety.&nbsp; And how could he gain the open country?&nbsp; If he succeeded
in reaching one of the gates&mdash;St. Antoine, or St. Denis, in itself
a task of difficulty&mdash;it would only be to find the gate closed,
and the guard on the alert.&nbsp; At last it flashed on him that he
might cross the river; and at the notion hope awoke.&nbsp; It was possible
that the massacre had not extended to the southern suburb; possible,
that if it had, the Huguenots who lay there&mdash;Frontenay, and Montgomery,
and Chartres, with the men of the North&mdash;might be strong enough
to check it, and even to turn the tables on the Parisians.</p>
<p>His colour returned.&nbsp; He was no coward, as soldiers go; if it
came to fighting he had courage enough.&nbsp; He could not hope to cross
the river by the bridge, for there, where the goldsmiths lived, the
mob were like to be most busy.&nbsp; But if he could reach the bank
he might procure a boat at some deserted point, or, at the worst, he
might swim across.</p>
<p>From the Louvre at his back came the sound of gunshots; from every
quarter the murmur of distant crowds, or the faint lamentable cries
of victims.&nbsp; But the empty street before him promised an easy passage,
and he ventured into it and passed quickly through it.&nbsp; He met
no one, and no one molested him; but as he went he had glimpses of pale
faces that from behind the casements watched him come and turned to
watch him go; and so heavy on his nerves was the pressure of this silent
ominous attention, that he blundered at the end of the street.&nbsp;
He should have taken the southerly turning; instead he held on, found
himself in the Rue Ferronerie, and a moment later was all but in the
arms of a band of city guards, who were making a house-to-house visitation.</p>
<p>He owed his safety rather to the condition of the street than to
his presence of mind.&nbsp; The Rue Ferronerie, narrow in itself, was
so choked at this date by stalls and bulkheads, that an edict directing
the removal of those which abutted on the cemetery had been issued a
little before.&nbsp; Nothing had been done on it, however, and this
neck of Paris, this main thoroughfare between the east and the west,
between the fashionable quarter of the Marais and the fashionable quarter
of the Louvre, was still a devious huddle of sheds and pent-houses.&nbsp;
Tignonville slid behind one of these, found that it masked the mouth
of an alley, and, heedless whither the passage led, ran hurriedly along
it.&nbsp; Every instant he expected to hear the hue and cry behind him,
and he did not halt or draw breath until he had left the soldiers far
in the rear, and found himself astray at the junction of four noisome
lanes, over two of which the projecting gables fairly met.&nbsp; Above
the two others a scrap of sky appeared, but this was too small to indicate
in which direction the river lay.</p>
<p>Tignonville hesitated, but not for long; a burst of voices heralded
a new danger, and he shrank into a doorway.&nbsp; Along one of the lanes
a troop of children, the biggest not twelve years old, came dancing
and leaping round something which they dragged by a string.&nbsp; Now
one of the hindmost would burl it onward with a kick, now another, amid
screams of childish laughter, tripped headlong over the cord; now at
the crossways they stopped to wrangle and question which way they should
go, or whose turn it was to pull and whose to follow.&nbsp; At last
they started afresh with a whoop, the leader singing and all plucking
the string to the cadence of the air.&nbsp; Their plaything leapt and
dropped, sprang forward, and lingered like a thing of life.&nbsp; But
it was no thing of life, as Tignonville saw with a shudder when they
passed him.&nbsp; The object of their sport was the naked body of a
child, an infant!</p>
<p>His gorge rose at the sight.&nbsp; Fear such as he had not before
experienced chilled his marrow.&nbsp; This was hate indeed, a hate before
which the strong man quailed; the hate of which Mademoiselle had spoken
when she said that the babes crossed themselves at her passing, and
the houses tottered to fall upon her!</p>
<p>He paused a minute to recover himself, so deeply had the sight moved
him; and as he stood, he wondered if that hate already had its cold
eye fixed on him.&nbsp; Instinctively his gaze searched the opposite
wall, but save for two small double-grated windows it was blind; time-stained
and stone-built, dark with the ordure of the city lane, it seemed but
the back of a house, which looked another way.&nbsp; The outer gates
of an arched doorway were open, and a loaded haycart, touching either
side and brushing the arch above, blocked the passage.&nbsp; His gaze,
leaving the windows, dropped to this&mdash;he scanned it a moment; and
on a sudden he stiffened.&nbsp; Between the hay and the arch a hand
flickered an instant, then vanished.</p>
<p>Tignonville stared.&nbsp; At first he thought his eyes had tricked
him.&nbsp; Then the hand appeared again, and this time it conveyed an
unmistakable invitation.&nbsp; It is not from the unknown or the hidden
that the fugitive has aught to fear, and Tignonville, after casting
a glance down the lane&mdash;which revealed a single man standing with
his face the other way&mdash;slipped across and pushed between the hay
and the wall.&nbsp; He coughed.</p>
<p>A voice whispered to him to climb up; a friendly hand clutched him
in the act, and aided him.&nbsp; In a second he was lying on his face,
tight squeezed between the hay and the roof of the arch.&nbsp; Beside
him lay a man whose features his eyes, unaccustomed to the gloom, could
not discern.&nbsp; But the man knew him and whispered his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me?&rdquo; Tignonville muttered in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I marked you, M. de Tignonville, at the preaching last Sunday,&rdquo;
the stranger answered placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I preached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are M. la Tribe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; the clergyman answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
seized me on my threshold, but I left my cloak in their hands and fled.&nbsp;
One tore my stocking with his point, another my doublet, but not a hair
of my head was injured.&nbsp; They hunted me to the end of the next
street, but I lived and still live, and shall live to lift up my voice
against this wicked city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sympathy between the Huguenot by faith and the Huguenot by politics
was imperfect.&nbsp; Tignonville, like most men of rank of the younger
generation, was a Huguenot by politics; and he was in a bitter humour.&nbsp;
He felt, perhaps, that it was men such as this who had driven the other
side to excesses such as these; and he hardly repressed a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I felt as sure!&rdquo; he muttered bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know that all our people are dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can save by few or by many,&rdquo; the preacher answered
devoutly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are of the few, blessed be God, and shall
see Israel victorious, and our people as a flock of sheep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see small chance of it,&rdquo; Tignonville answered contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it as certainly as I knew before you came, M. de Tignonville,
that you would come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>I</i> should come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That some one would come,&rdquo; La Tribe answered, correcting
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew not who it would be until you appeared
and placed yourself in the doorway over against me, even as Obadiah
in the Holy Book passed before the hiding-place of Elijah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two lay on their faces side by side, the rafters of the archway
low on their heads.&nbsp; Tignonville lifted himself a little, and peered
anew at the other.&nbsp; He fancied that La Tribe&rsquo;s mind, shaken
by the horrors of the morning and his narrow escape, had given way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rave, man,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no time
for visions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said naught of visions,&rdquo; the other answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why so sure that we shall escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certified of it,&rdquo; La Tribe replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
more than that, I know that we shall lie here some days.&nbsp; The time
has not been revealed to me, but it will be days and a day.&nbsp; Then
we shall leave this place unharmed, as we entered it, and, whatever
betide others, we shall live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you, you
rave, M. la Tribe,&rdquo; he said petulantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any moment
we may be discovered.&nbsp; Even now I hear footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tracked me well-nigh to this place,&rdquo; the minister
answered placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce they did!&rdquo; Tignonville muttered, with irritation.&nbsp;
He dared not raise his voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would you had told me that
before I joined you, Monsieur, and I had found some safer hiding-place!&nbsp;
When we are discovered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; the other continued calmly, &ldquo;you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case we shall be better farther back,&rdquo; Tignonville
retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, we are within an ace of being seen from
the lane.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he began to wriggle himself backwards.</p>
<p>The minister laid his hand on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have a care!&rdquo;
he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do not move, but listen.&nbsp; And you
will understand.&nbsp; When I reached this place&mdash;it would be about
five o&rsquo;clock this morning&mdash;breathless, and expecting each
minute to be dragged forth to make my confession before men, I despaired
as you despair now.&nbsp; Like Elijah under the juniper tree, I said,
&lsquo;It is enough, O Lord!&nbsp; Take my soul also, for I am no better
than my fellows!&rsquo;&nbsp; All the sky was black before my eyes,
and my ears were filled with the wailings of the little ones and the
lamentations of women.&nbsp; &lsquo;O Lord, it is enough,&rsquo; I prayed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Take my soul, or, if it be Thy will, then, as the angel was sent
to take the cakes to Elijah, give me also a sign that I shall live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he paused, struggling with overpowering emotion.&nbsp;
Even his impatient listener, hitherto incredulous, caught the infection,
and in a tone of awe murmured&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&nbsp; And then, M. la Tribe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sign was given me.&nbsp; The words were scarcely out of
my mouth when a hen flew up, and, scratching a nest in the hay at my
feet, presently laid an egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was timely, I admit,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is no uncommon thing.&nbsp; Probably it has
its nest here and lays daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, this is new-mown hay,&rdquo; the minister answered
solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This cart was brought here no further back than
yesterday.&nbsp; It smells of the meadow, and the flowers hold their
colour.&nbsp; No, the fowl was sent.&nbsp; To-morrow it will return,
and the next, and the next, until the plague be stayed and I go hence.&nbsp;
But that is not all.&nbsp; A while later a second hen appeared, and
I thought it would lay in the same nest.&nbsp; But it made a new one,
on the side on which you lie and not far from your foot.&nbsp; Then
I knew that I was to have a companion, and that God had laid also for
him a table in the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did lay, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is still on the nest, beside your foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville was about to reply when the preacher grasped his arm
and by a sign enjoined silence.&nbsp; He did so not a moment too soon.&nbsp;
Preoccupied by the story, narrator and listener had paid no heed to
what was passing in the lane, and the voices of men speaking close at
hand took them by surprise.&nbsp; From the first words which reached
them, it was clear that the speakers were the same who had chased La
Tribe as far as the meeting of the four ways, and, losing him there,
had spent the morning in other business.&nbsp; Now they had returned
to hunt him down; and but for a wrangle which arose among them and detained
them, they had stolen on their quarry before their coming was suspected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas this way he ran!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, &rsquo;twas
the other!&rdquo; they contended; and their words, winged with vile
threats and oaths, grew noisy and hot.&nbsp; The two listeners dared
scarcely to breathe.&nbsp; The danger was so near, it was so certain
that if the men came three paces farther, they would observe and search
the haycart, that Tignonville fancied the steel already at his throat.&nbsp;
He felt the hay rustle under his slightest movement, and gripped one
hand with the other to restrain the tremor of overpowering excitement.&nbsp;
Yet when he glanced at the minister he found him unmoved, a smile on
his face.&nbsp; And M. de Tignonville could have cursed him for his
folly.</p>
<p>For the men were coming on!&nbsp; An instant, and they perceived
the cart, and the ruffian who had advised this route pounced on it in
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&nbsp; Did I not say so?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is curled up in that hay, for the Satan&rsquo;s grub he is!&nbsp; That
is where he is, see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; another answered grudgingly, as they gathered
before it.&nbsp; &ldquo;And maybe not, Simon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with your maybe not!&rdquo; the first replied.&nbsp;
And he drove his pike deep into the hay and turned it viciously.</p>
<p>The two on the top controlled themselves.&nbsp; Tignonville&rsquo;s
face was livid; of himself he would have slid down amongst them and
taken his chance, preferring to die fighting, to die in the open, rather
than to perish like a rat in a stack.&nbsp; But La Tribe had gripped
his arm and held him fast.</p>
<p>The man whom the others called Simon thrust again, but too low and
without result.&nbsp; He was for trying a third time, when one of his
comrades who had gone to the other side of the lane announced that the
men were on the top of the hay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there&rsquo;s room and to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a curse on your room!&rdquo; Simon retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
you can look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all, I&rsquo;ll soon look!&rdquo; was the
answer.&nbsp; And the rogue, forcing himself between the hay and the
side of the gateway, found the wheel of the cart, and began to raise
himself on it.</p>
<p>Tignonville, who lay on that hand, heard, though he could not see
his movements.&nbsp; He knew what they meant, he knew that in a twinkling
he must be discovered; and with a last prayer he gathered himself for
a spring.</p>
<p>It seemed an age before the intruder&rsquo;s head appeared on a level
with the hay; and then the alarm came from another quarter.&nbsp; The
hen which had made its nest at Tignonville&rsquo;s feet, disturbed by
the movement or by the newcomer&rsquo;s hand, flew out with a rush and
flutter as of a great firework.&nbsp; Upsetting the startled Simon,
who slipped swearing to the ground, it swooped scolding and clucking
over the heads of the other men, and reaching the street in safety,
scuttled off at speed, its outspread wings sweeping the earth in its
rage.</p>
<p>They laughed uproariously as Simon emerged, rubbing his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s for you!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s your preacher!&rdquo;
his opponent jeered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D---n her! she gives tongue as fast as any of them!&rdquo;
gibed a second.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you try again, Simon?&nbsp; You may
find another love-letter there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have done!&rdquo; a third cried impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
not be where the hen is!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s back!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s back!&nbsp;
I said before that it wasn&rsquo;t this way he turned!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
made for the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plague in his vitals!&rdquo; Simon replied furiously.
&ldquo;Wherever he is, I&rsquo;ll find him!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, reluctant
to confess himself wrong, he lingered, casting vengeful glances at the
hay.</p>
<p>But one of the other men cursed him for a fool; and presently, forced
to accept his defeat or be left alone, he rejoined his fellows.&nbsp;
Slowly the footsteps and voices receded along the lane; slowly, until
silence swallowed them, and on the quivering strained senses of the
two who remained behind, descended the gentle influence of twilight
and the sweet scent of the new-mown hay on which they lay.</p>
<p>La Tribe turned to his companion, his eyes shining.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
soul is escaped,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;even as a bird out of the
snare of the fowler.&nbsp; The snare is broken and we are delivered!&rdquo;&nbsp;
His voice shook as he whispered the ancient words of triumph.</p>
<p>But when they came to look in the nest at Tignonville&rsquo;s feet
there was no egg!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; UNSTABLE.</h2>
<p>And that troubled M. la Tribe no little, although he did not impart
his thoughts to his companion.&nbsp; Instead they talked in whispers
of the things which had happened; of the Admiral, of Teligny, whom all
loved, of Rochefoucauld the accomplished, the King&rsquo;s friend; of
the princes in the Louvre whom they gave up for lost, and of the Huguenot
nobles on the farther side of the river, of whose safety there seemed
some hope.&nbsp; Tignonville&mdash;he best knew why&mdash;said nothing
of the fate of his betrothed, or of his own adventures in that connection.&nbsp;
But each told the other how the alarm had reached him, and painted in
broken words his reluctance to believe in treachery so black.&nbsp;
Thence they passed to the future of the cause, and of that took views
as opposite as light and darkness, as Papegot and Huguenot.&nbsp; The
one was confident, the other in despair.&nbsp; And some time in the
afternoon, worn out by the awful experiences of the last twelve hours,
they fell asleep, their heads on their arms, the hay tickling their
faces; and, with death stalking the lane beside them, slept soundly
until after sundown.</p>
<p>When they awoke hunger awoke with them, and urged on La Tribe&rsquo;s
mind the question of the missing egg.&nbsp; It was not altogether the
prick of appetite which troubled him, but regarding the hiding-place
in which they lay as an ark of refuge providentially supplied, protected
and victualled, he could not refrain from asking reverently what the
deficiency meant.&nbsp; It was not as if one hen only had appeared;
as if no farther prospect had been extended.&nbsp; But up to a certain
point the message was clear.&nbsp; Then when the Hand of Providence
had shown itself most plainly, and in a manner to melt the heart with
awe and thankfulness, the message had been blurred.&nbsp; Seriously
the Huguenot asked himself what it portended.</p>
<p>To Tignonville, if he thought of it at all, the matter was the matter
of an egg, and stopped there.&nbsp; An egg might alleviate the growing
pangs of hunger; its non-appearance was a disappointment, but he traced
the matter no farther.&nbsp; It must be confessed, too, that the haycart
was to him only a haycart&mdash;and not an ark; and the sooner he was
safely away from it the better he would be pleased.&nbsp; While La Tribe,
lying snug and warm beside him, thanked God for a lot so different from
that of such of his fellows as had escaped&mdash;whom he pictured crouching
in dank cellars, or on roof-trees exposed to the heat by day and the
dews by night&mdash;the young man grew more and more restive.</p>
<p>Hunger pricked him, and the meanness of the part he had played moved
him to action.&nbsp; About midnight, resisting the dissuasions of his
companion, he would have sallied out in search of food if the passage
of a turbulent crowd had not warned him that the work of murder was
still proceeding.&nbsp; He curbed himself after that and lay until daylight.&nbsp;
But, ill content with his own conduct, on fire when he thought of his
betrothed, he was in no temper to bear hardship cheerfully or long;
and gradually there rose before his mind the picture of Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s
smiling face, and the fair hair which curled low on the white of her
neck.</p>
<p>He would, and he would not.&nbsp; Death that had stalked so near
him preached its solemn sermon.&nbsp; But death and pleasure are never
far apart; and at no time and nowhere have they jostled one another
more familiarly than in that age, wherever the influence of Italy and
Italian art and Italian hopelessness extended.&nbsp; Again, on the one
side, La Tribe&rsquo;s example went for something with his comrade in
misfortune; but in the other scale hung relief from discomfort, with
the prospect of a woman&rsquo;s smiles and a woman&rsquo;s flatteries,
of dainty dishes, luxury, and passion.&nbsp; If he went now, he went
to her from the jaws of death, with the glamour of adventure and peril
about him; and the very going into her presence was a lure.&nbsp; Moreover,
if he had been willing while his betrothed was still his, why not now
when he had lost her?</p>
<p>It was this last reflection&mdash;and one other thing which came
on a sudden into his mind&mdash;which turned the scale.&nbsp; About
noon he sat up in the hay, and, abruptly and sullenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
lie here no longer,&rdquo; he said; and he dropped his legs over the
side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movement was so unexpected that La Tribe stared at him in silence.&nbsp;
Then, &ldquo;You will run a great risk, M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; he
said gravely, &ldquo;if you do.&nbsp; You may go as far under cover
of night as the river, or you may reach one of the gates.&nbsp; But
as to crossing the one or passing the other, I reckon it a thing impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not wait until night,&rdquo; Tignonville answered
curtly, a ring of defiance in his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall go now!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll lie here no longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be mad if you do,&rdquo; the other replied.&nbsp;
He thought it the petulant outcry of youth tired of inaction; a protest,
and nothing more.</p>
<p>He was speedily undeceived.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mad or not, I am going!&rdquo;
Tignonville retorted.&nbsp; And he slid to the ground, and from the
covert of the hanging fringe of hay looked warily up and down the lane.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is clear, I think,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And with no more, without one upward glance or a gesture of the hand,
with no further adieu or word of gratitude, he walked out into the lane,
turned briskly to the left, and vanished.</p>
<p>The minister uttered a cry of surprise, and made as if he would descend
also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, sir!&rdquo; he called, as loudly as he dared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;M. de Tignonville, come back!&nbsp; This is folly or worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But M. de Tignonville was gone.</p>
<p>La Tribe listened a while, unable to believe it, and still expecting
his return.&nbsp; At last, hearing nothing, he slid, greatly excited,
to the ground and looked out.&nbsp; It was not until he had peered up
and down the lane and made sure that it was empty that he could persuade
himself that the other had gone for good.&nbsp; Then he climbed slowly
and seriously to his place again, and sighed as he settled himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unstable as water thou shalt not excel!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now I know why there was only one egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tignonville, after putting a hundred yards between himself
and his bedfellow, plunged into the first dark entry which presented
itself.&nbsp; Hurriedly, and with a frowning face, he cut off his left
sleeve from shoulder to wrist; and this act, by disclosing his linen,
put him in possession of the white sleeve which he had once involuntarily
donned, and once discarded.&nbsp; The white cross on the cap he could
not assume, for he was bareheaded.&nbsp; But he had little doubt that
the sleeve would suffice, and with a bold demeanour he made his way
northward until he reached again the Rue Ferronerie.</p>
<p>Excited groups were wandering up and down the street, and, fearing
to traverse its crowded narrows, he went by lanes parallel with it as
far as the Rue St. Denis, which he crossed.&nbsp; Everywhere he saw
houses gutted and doors burst in, and traces of a cruelty and a fanaticism
almost incredible.&nbsp; Near the Rue des Lombards he saw a dead child,
stripped stark and hanged on the hook of a cobbler&rsquo;s shutter.&nbsp;
A little farther on in the same street he stepped over the body of a
handsome young woman, distinguished by the length and beauty of her
hair.&nbsp; To obtain her bracelets, her captors had cut off her hands;
afterwards&mdash;but God knows how long afterwards&mdash;a passer-by,
more pitiful than his fellows, had put her out of her misery with a
spit, which still remained plunged in her body.</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville shuddered at the sight, and at others like it.&nbsp;
He loathed the symbol he wore, and himself for wearing it; and more
than once his better nature bade him return and play the nobler part.&nbsp;
Once he did turn with that intention.&nbsp; But he had set his mind
on comfort and pleasure, and the value of these things is raised, not
lowered, by danger and uncertainty.&nbsp; Quickly his stoicism oozed
away; he turned again.&nbsp; Barely avoiding the rush of a crowd of
wretches who were bearing a swooning victim to the river, he hurried
through the Rue des Lombards, and reached in safety the house beside
the Golden Maid.</p>
<p>He had no doubt now on which side of the Maid Madame St. Lo lived;
the house was plain before him.&nbsp; He had only to knock.&nbsp; But
in proportion as he approached his haven, his anxiety grew.&nbsp; To
lose all, with all in his grasp, to fail upon the threshold, was a thing
which bore no looking at; and it was with a nervous hand and eyes cast
fearfully behind him that he plied the heavy iron knocker which adorned
the door.</p>
<p>He could not turn his gaze from a knot of ruffians, who were gathered
under one of the tottering gables on the farther side of the street.&nbsp;
They seemed to be watching him, and he fancied&mdash;though the distance
rendered this impossible&mdash;that he could see suspicion growing in
their eyes.&nbsp; At any moment they might cross the roadway, they might
approach, they might challenge him.&nbsp; And at the thought he knocked
and knocked again.&nbsp; Why did not the porter come?</p>
<p>Ay, why?&nbsp; For now a score of contingencies came into the young
man&rsquo;s mind and tortured him.&nbsp; Had Madame St. Lo withdrawn
to safer quarters and closed the house?&nbsp; Or, good Catholic as she
was, had she given way to panic, and determined to open to no one?&nbsp;
Or was she ill?&nbsp; Or had she perished in the general disorder?&nbsp;
Or&mdash;</p>
<p>And then, even as the men began to slink towards him, his heart leapt.&nbsp;
He heard a footstep heavy and slow move through the house.&nbsp; It
came nearer and nearer.&nbsp; A moment, and an iron-grated Judas-hole
in the door slid open, and a servant, an elderly man, sleek and respectable,
looked out at him.</p>
<p>Tignonville could scarcely speak for excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame
St. Lo?&rdquo; he muttered tremulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come to her from
her cousin the Comte de Tavannes.&nbsp; Quick! quick! if you please.&nbsp;
Open to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded gravely and slid back the bolts.&nbsp; He allowed
M. de Tignonville to enter, then with care he secured the door, and
led the way across a small square court, paved with red tiles and enclosed
by the house, but open above to the sunshine and the blue sky.&nbsp;
A gallery which ran round the upper floor looked on this court, in which
a great quiet reigned, broken only by the music of a fountain.&nbsp;
A vine climbed on the wooden pillars which supported the gallery, and,
aspiring higher, embraced the wide carved eaves, and even tapestried
with green the three gables that on each side of the court broke the
skyline.&nbsp; The grapes hung nearly ripe, and amid their clusters
and the green lattice of their foliage Tignonville&rsquo;s gaze sought
eagerly but in vain the laughing eyes and piquant face of his new mistress.&nbsp;
For with the closing of the door, and the passing from him of the horrors
of the streets, he had entered, as by magic, a new and smiling world;
a world of tennis and roses, of tinkling voices and women&rsquo;s wiles,
a world which smacked of Florence and the South, and love and life;
a world which his late experiences had set so far away from him, his
memory of it seemed a dream.&nbsp; Now, as he drank in its stillness
and its fragrance, as he felt its safety and its luxury lap him round
once more, he sighed.&nbsp; And with that breath he rid himself of much.</p>
<p>The servant led him to a parlour, a cool shady room on the farther
side of the tiny quadrangle, and, muttering something inaudible, withdrew.&nbsp;
A moment later a frolicsome laugh, and the light flutter of a woman&rsquo;s
skirt as she tripped across the court, brought the blood to his cheeks.&nbsp;
He went a step nearer to the door, and his eyes grew bright.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&nbsp; MADAME ST. LO.</h2>
<p>So far excitement had supported Tignonville in his escape.&nbsp;
It was only when he knew himself safe, when he heard Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s
footstep in the courtyard and knew that in a moment he would see her,
that he knew also that he was failing for want of food.&nbsp; The room
seemed to go round with him; the window to shift, the light to flicker.&nbsp;
And then again, with equal abruptness, he grew strong and steady and
perfectly master of himself.&nbsp; Nay, never had he felt a confidence
in himself so overwhelming or a capacity so complete.&nbsp; The triumph
of that which he had done, the knowledge that of so many he, almost
alone, had escaped, filled his brain with a delicious and intoxicating
vanity.&nbsp; When the door opened, and Madame St. Lo appeared on the
threshold, he advanced holding out his arms.&nbsp; He expected that
she would fall into them.</p>
<p>But Madame only backed and curtseyed, a mischievous light in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, Monsieur!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you
are more ready than I!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she remained by the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to you through all!&rdquo; he cried, speaking
loudly because of a humming in his ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are lying
in the streets!&nbsp; They are dying, are dead, are hunted, are pursued,
are perishing!&nbsp; But I have come through all to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She curtseyed anew.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I see, Monsieur!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am flattered!&rdquo;&nbsp; But she did not advance, and gradually,
light-headed as he was, he began to see that she looked at him with
an odd closeness.&nbsp; And he took offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Madame, I have come to you!&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you do not seem pleased!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came forward a step and looked at him still more oddly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am pleased, M. de
Tignonville.&nbsp; It is what I intended.&nbsp; But tell me how you
have fared.&nbsp; You are not hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a hair!&rdquo; he cried boastfully.&nbsp; And he told
her in a dozen windy sentences of the adventure of the haycart and his
narrow escape.&nbsp; He wound up with a foolish meaningless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have not eaten for thirty-six hours?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
And when he did not answer, &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she continued,
nodding and speaking as to a child.&nbsp; And she rang a silver handbell
and gave an order.</p>
<p>She addressed the servant in her usual tone, but to Tignonville&rsquo;s
ear her voice seemed to fall to a whisper.&nbsp; Her figure&mdash;she
was small and fairy-like&mdash;began to sway before him; and then in
a moment, as it seemed to him, she was gone, and he was seated at a
table, his trembling fingers grasping a cup of wine which the elderly
servant who had admitted him was holding to his lips.&nbsp; On the table
before him were a spit of partridges and a cake of white bread.&nbsp;
When he had swallowed a second mouthful of wine&mdash;which cleared
his eyes as by magic&mdash;the man urged him to eat.&nbsp; And he fell
to with an appetite that grew as he ate.</p>
<p>By-and-by, feeling himself again, he became aware that two of Madame&rsquo;s
women were peering at him through the open doorway.&nbsp; He looked
that way and they fled giggling into the court; but in a moment they
were back again, and the sound of their tittering drew his eyes anew
to the door.&nbsp; It was the custom of the day for ladies of rank to
wait on their favourites at table; and he wondered if Madame were with
them, and why she did not come and serve him herself.</p>
<p>But for a while longer the savour of the roasted game took up the
major part of his thoughts; and when prudence warned him to desist,
and he sat back, satisfied after his long fast, he was in no mood to
be critical.&nbsp; Perhaps&mdash;for somewhere in the house he heard
a lute&mdash;Madame was entertaining those whom she could not leave?&nbsp;
Or deluding some who might betray him if they discovered him?</p>
<p>From that his mind turned back to the streets and the horrors through
which he had passed; but for a moment and no more.&nbsp; A shudder,
an emotion of prayerful pity, and he recalled his thoughts.&nbsp; In
the quiet of the cool room, looking on the sunny, vine-clad court, with
the tinkle of the lute and the murmurous sound of women&rsquo;s voices
in his ears, it was hard to believe that the things from which he had
emerged were real.&nbsp; It was still more unpleasant, and as futile,
to dwell on them.&nbsp; A day of reckoning would come, and, if La Tribe
were right, the cause would rally, bristling with pikes and snorting
with war-horses, and the blood spilled in this wicked city would cry
aloud for vengeance.&nbsp; But the hour was not yet.&nbsp; He had lost
his mistress, and for that atonement must be exacted.&nbsp; But in the
present another mistress awaited him, and as a man could only die once,
and might die at any minute, so he could only live once, and in the
present.&nbsp; Then <i>vogue la gal&egrave;re</i>!</p>
<p>As he roused himself from this brief reverie and fell to wondering
how long he was to be left to himself, a rosebud tossed by an unseen
hand struck him on the breast and dropped to his knees.&nbsp; To seize
it and kiss it gallantly, to spring to his feet and look about him were
instinctive movements.&nbsp; But he could see no one; and, in the hope
of surprising the giver, he stole to the window.&nbsp; The sound of
the lute and the distant tinkle of laughter persisted.&nbsp; The court,
save for a page, who lay asleep on a bench in the gallery, was empty.&nbsp;
Tignonville scanned the boy suspiciously; a male disguise was often
adopted by the court ladies, and if Madame would play a prank on him,
this was a thing to be reckoned with.&nbsp; But a boy it seemed to be,
and after a while the young man went back to his seat.</p>
<p>Even as he sat down, a second flower struck him more sharply in the
face, and this time he darted not to the window but to the door.&nbsp;
He opened it quickly and looked out, but again he was too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall catch you presently, <i>ma reine</i>!&rdquo; he murmured
tenderly, with intent to be heard.&nbsp; And he closed the door.&nbsp;
But, wiser this time, he waited with his hand on the latch until he
heard the rustling of a skirt, and saw the line of light at the foot
of the door darkened by a shadow.&nbsp; That moment he flung the door
wide, and, clasping the wearer of the skirt in his arms, kissed her
lips before she had time to resist.</p>
<p>Then he fell back as if he had been shot!&nbsp; For the wearer of
the skirt, she whom he had kissed, was Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s woman,
and behind her stood Madame herself, laughing, laughing, laughing with
all the gay abandonment of her light little heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the gallant gentleman!&rdquo; she cried, and clapped her
hands effusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was ever recovery so rapid?&nbsp; Or
triumph so speedy?&nbsp; Suzanne, my child; you surpass Venus.&nbsp;
Your charms conquer before they are seen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville had put poor Suzanne from him as if she burned;
and hot and embarrassed, cursing his haste, he stood looking awkwardly
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he stammered at last, &ldquo;you know quite
well that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing is believing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I thought it was you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what I have lost!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; And she looked
archly at Suzanne, who giggled and tossed her head.</p>
<p>He was growing angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, Madame,&rdquo; he protested,
&ldquo;you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I know, and I have seen what I have seen!&rdquo;
Madame answered merrily.&nbsp; And she hummed,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ce fut le plus grand jour d&rsquo;est&eacute;<br />
Que m&rsquo;embrassa la belle Suzanne!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yes, I know what I know!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; And she fell
again to laughing immoderately; while the pretty piece of mischief beside
her hung her head, and, putting a finger in her mouth, mocked him with
an affectation of modesty.</p>
<p>The young man glowered at them between rage and embarrassment.&nbsp;
This was not the reception, nor this the hero&rsquo;s return to which
he had looked forward.&nbsp; And a doubt began to take form in his mind.&nbsp;
The mistress he had pictured would not laugh at kisses given to another;
nor forget in a twinkling the straits through which he had come to her,
the hell from which he had plucked himself!&nbsp; Possibly the court
ladies held love as cheap as this, and lovers but as playthings, butts
for their wit, and pegs on which to hang their laughter.&nbsp; But&mdash;but
he began to doubt, and, perplexed and irritated, he showed his feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;a jest is an excellent
thing.&nbsp; But pardon me if I say that it is ill played on a fasting
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame desisted from laughter that she might speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
fasting man?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he has eaten two partridges!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasting from love, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo held up her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not
two minutes since he took a kiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced, was silent a moment, and then seeing that he got nothing
by the tone he had adopted he cried for quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little mercy, Madame, as you are beautiful,&rdquo; he said,
wooing her with his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not plague me beyond what
a man can bear.&nbsp; Dismiss, I pray you, this good creature&mdash;whose
charms do but set off yours as the star leads the eye to the moon&mdash;and
make me the happiest man in the world by so much of your company as
you will vouchsafe to give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be but a very little,&rdquo; she answered, letting
her eyes fall coyly, and affecting to handle the tucker of her low ruff.&nbsp;
But he saw that her lip twitched; and he could have sworn that she mocked
him to Suzanne, for the girl giggled.</p>
<p>Still by an effort he controlled his feelings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so
cruel?&rdquo; he murmured, in a tone meant for her alone, and with a
look to match.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were not so hard when I spoke with you
in the gallery, two evenings ago, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I not?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I look like
this?&nbsp; And this?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, languishing, she looked at him
very sweetly after two fashions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then I meant nothing!&rdquo; she retorted with sudden
vivacity.&nbsp; And she made a face at him, laughing under his nose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do that when I mean nothing, Monsieur!&nbsp; Do you see?&nbsp;
But you are Gascon, and given, I fear, to flatter yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he saw clearly that she played with him: and resentment, chagrin,
pique got the better of his courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I flatter myself?&rdquo; he cried, his voice choked with rage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may be I do now, Madame, but did I flatter myself when you
wrote me this note?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he drew it out and flourished it
in her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did I imagine when I read this?&nbsp; Or is
it not in your hand?&nbsp; It is a forgery, perhaps,&rdquo; he continued
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or it means nothing?&nbsp; Nothing, this note
bidding me be at Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s at an hour before midnight&mdash;it
means nothing?&nbsp; At an hour before midnight, Madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night?&nbsp; The night before last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday night, the night before last night!&nbsp; But
Madame knows nothing of it?&nbsp; Nothing, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and smiled cheerfully on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
yes, I wrote it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what of that, M.
de Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, what of that?&nbsp; Did you think it was written
out of love for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was staggered for the moment by her coolness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out
of what, then?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out of what, then,
if not out of love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, out of pity, my little gentleman!&rdquo; she answered
sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And trouble thrown away, it seems.&nbsp; Love!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she laughed so merrily and spontaneously it cut him to the heart.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No; but you said a dainty thing or two, and smiled a smile; and
like a fool, and like a woman, I was sorry for the innocent calf that
bleated so prettily on its way to the butcher&rsquo;s!&nbsp; And I would
lock you up, and save your life, I thought, until the blood-letting
was over.&nbsp; Now you have it, M. de Tignonville, and I hope you like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like it, when every word she uttered stripped him of the selfish
illusions in which he had wrapped himself against the blasts of ill-fortune?&nbsp;
Like it, when the prospect of her charms had bribed him from the path
of fortitude, when for her sake he had been false to his mistress, to
his friends, to his faith, to his cause?&nbsp; Like it, when he knew
as he listened that all was lost, and nothing gained, not even this
poor, unworthy, shameful compensation?&nbsp; Like it?&nbsp; No wonder
that words failed him, and he glared at her in rage, in misery, in shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she continued, tossing
her head after a momentary pause, &ldquo;then you should not have come!&nbsp;
It is of no profit to glower at me, Monsieur.&nbsp; You do not frighten
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would&mdash;I would to God I had not come!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, I dare say, that you had never seen me&mdash;since you
cannot win me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That too,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>She was of an extraordinary levity, and at that, after staring at
him a moment, she broke into shrill laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more, and I&rsquo;ll send you to my cousin Hannibal!&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not know how anxious he is to see you.&nbsp;
Have you a mind,&rdquo; with a waggish look, &ldquo;to play bride&rsquo;s
man, M. de Tignonville?&nbsp; Or will you give away the bride?&nbsp;
It is not too late, though soon it will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He winced, and from red grew pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
he stammered; and, averting his eyes in shame, seeing now all the littleness,
all the baseness of his position, &ldquo;Has he&mdash;married her?&rdquo;
he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo; she cried in triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
hit you now, have I, Monsieur?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve hit you!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And mocking him, &ldquo;Has he&mdash;married her?&rdquo; she lisped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No; but he will marry her, have no fear of that!&nbsp; He will
marry her.&nbsp; He waits but to get a priest.&nbsp; Would you like
to see what he says?&rdquo; she continued, playing with him as a cat
plays with a mouse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a note from him yesterday.&nbsp;
Would you like to see how welcome you&rsquo;ll be at the wedding?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she flaunted a piece of paper before his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She let him seize it the while she shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your affair, not mine,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;See
it if you like, and keep it if you like.&nbsp; Cousin Hannibal wastes
few words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was true, for the paper contained but a dozen or fifteen words,
and an initial by way of signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may need your shaveling to-morrow afternoon.&nbsp; Send
him, and Tignonville in safeguard if he come.&mdash;H.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can guess what use he has for a priest,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not to confess him, I warrant.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s long, I
fear, since Hannibal told his beads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville swore.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would I had the confessing
of him!&rdquo; he said between his teeth.</p>
<p>She clapped her hands in glee.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should you not?&rdquo;
she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should you not?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time yet,
since I am to send to-day and have not sent.&nbsp; Will you be the shaveling
to go confess or marry him?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she laughed recklessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you, M. de Tignonville?&nbsp; The cowl will mask you as
well as another, and pass you through the streets better than a cut
sleeve.&nbsp; He will have both his wishes, lover and clerk in one then.&nbsp;
And it will be pull monk, pull Hannibal with a vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville gazed at her, and as he gazed courage and hope awoke
in his eyes.&nbsp; What if, after all, he could undo the past?&nbsp;
What if, after all, he could retrace the false step he had taken, and
place himself again where he had been&mdash;by <i>her</i> side?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you meant it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his breath coming fast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you only meant what you say, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If?&rdquo; she answered, opening her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
why should I not mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;cowl or no cowl,
when I meet your cousin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill go hard with him?&rdquo; she cried, with a mocking
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you think I fear for him.&nbsp; That is it,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear just <i>so much</i> for him!&rdquo; she retorted with
contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just so much!&rdquo;&nbsp; And coming a step
nearer to Tignonville she snapped her small white fingers under his
nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you see?&nbsp; No, M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;you do not know Count Hannibal if you think that he
fears, or that any fear for him.&nbsp; If you will beard the lion in
his den, the risk will be yours, not his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s face glowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take the risk!&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I thank you for the chance; that, Madame,
whatever betide.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; she asked, seeing that he hesitated and that
his face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he afterwards learn that you have played him a trick,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;will he not punish you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punish me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>Madame laughed her high disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not yet know
Hannibal de Tavannes,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He does not war
with women.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; A BARGAIN.</h2>
<p>It is the wont of the sex to snatch at an ell where an inch is offered,
and to press an advantage in circumstances in which a man, acknowledging
the claims of generosity, scruples to ask for more.&nbsp; The habit,
now ingrained, may have sprung from long dependence on the male, and
is one which a hundred instances, from the time of Judith downwards,
prove to be at its strongest where the need is greatest.</p>
<p>When Mademoiselle de Vrillac came out of the hour-long swoon into
which her lover&rsquo;s defection had cast her, the expectation of the
worst was so strong upon her that she could not at once credit the respite
which Madame Carlat hastened to announce.&nbsp; She could not believe
that she still lay safe, in her own room above stairs; that she was
in the care of her own servants, and that the chamber held no presence
more hateful than that of the good woman who sat weeping beside her.</p>
<p>As was to be expected, she came to herself sighing and shuddering,
trembling with nervous exhaustion.&nbsp; She looked for <i>him</i>,
as soon as she looked for any; and even when she had seen the door locked
and double-locked, she doubted&mdash;doubted, and shook and hid herself
in the hangings of the bed.&nbsp; The noise of the riot and rapine which
prevailed in the city, and which reached the ear even in that locked
room&mdash;and although the window, of paper, with an upper pane of
glass, looked into a courtyard&mdash;was enough to drive the blood from
a woman&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; But it was fear of the house, not of the
street, fear from within, not from without, which impelled the girl
into the darkest corner and shook her wits.&nbsp; She could not believe
that even this short respite was hers, until she had repeatedly heard
the fact confirmed at Madame Carlat&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are deceiving me!&rdquo; she cried more than once.&nbsp;
And each time she started up in fresh terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never
said that he would not return until to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, my lamb, he did!&rdquo; the old woman answered with
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would I deceive you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would not return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would not return until to-morrow.&nbsp; You had
until to-morrow, he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would come and bring the priest with him,&rdquo; Madame
Carlat replied sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priest?&nbsp; To-morrow!&rdquo; Mademoiselle cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The priest!&rdquo; and she crouched anew with hot eyes behind
the hangings of the bed, and, shivering, hid her face.</p>
<p>But this for a time only.&nbsp; As soon as she had made certain of
the respite, and that she had until the morrow, her courage rose, and
with it the instinct of which mention has been made.&nbsp; Count Hannibal
had granted a respite; short as it was, and no more than the barest
humanity required, to grant one at all was not the act of the mere butcher
who holds the trembling lamb, unresisting, in his hands.&nbsp; It was
an act&mdash;no more, again be it said, than humanity required&mdash;and
yet an act which bespoke an expectation of some return, of some correlative
advantage.&nbsp; It was not in the part of the mere brigand.&nbsp; Something
had been granted.&nbsp; Something short of the utmost in the captor&rsquo;s
power had been exacted.&nbsp; He had shown that there were things he
would not do.</p>
<p>Then might not something more be won from him?&nbsp; A further delay,
another point; something, no matter what, which could be turned to advantage?&nbsp;
With the brigand it is not possible to bargain.&nbsp; But who gives
a little may give more; who gives a day may give a week; who gives a
week may give a month.&nbsp; And a month?&nbsp; Her heart leapt up.&nbsp;
A month seemed a lifetime, an eternity, to her who had but until to-morrow!</p>
<p>Yet there was one consideration which might have daunted a spirit
less brave.&nbsp; To obtain aught from Tavannes it was needful to ask
him, and to ask him it was needful to see him; and to see him <i>before</i>
that to-morrow which meant so much to her.&nbsp; It was necessary, in
a word, to run some risk; but without risk the card could not be played,
and she did not hesitate.&nbsp; It might turn out that she was wrong,
that the man was not only pitiless and without bowels of mercy, but
lacked also the shred of decency for which she gave him credit, and
on which she counted.&nbsp; In that case, if she sent for him&mdash;but
she would not consider that case.</p>
<p>The position of the window, while it increased the women&rsquo;s
safety, debarred them from all knowledge of what was going forward,
except that which their ears afforded them.&nbsp; They had no means
of judging whether Tavannes remained in the house or had sallied forth
to play his part in the work of murder.&nbsp; Madame Carlat, indeed,
had no desire to know anything.&nbsp; In that room above stairs, with
the door double-locked, lay a hope of safety in the present, and of
ultimate deliverance; there she had a respite from terror, as long as
she kept the world outside.&nbsp; To her, therefore, the notion of sending
for Tavannes, or communicating with him, came as a thunderbolt.&nbsp;
Was her mistress mad?&nbsp; Did she wish to court her fate?&nbsp; To
reach Tavannes they must apply to his riders, for Carlat and the men-servants
were confined above.&nbsp; Those riders were grim, brutal men, who might
resort to rudeness on their own account.&nbsp; And Madame, clinging
in a paroxysm of terror to her mistress, suggested all manner of horrors,
one on top of the other, until she increased her own terror tenfold.&nbsp;
And yet, to do her justice, nothing that even her frenzied imagination
suggested exceeded the things which the streets of Paris, fruitful mother
of horrors, were witnessing at that very hour.&nbsp; As we now know.</p>
<p>For it was noon&mdash;or a little more&mdash;of Sunday, August the
twenty-fourth, &ldquo;a holiday, and therefore the people could more
conveniently find leisure to kill and plunder.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the
bridges, and particularly from the stone bridge of Notre Dame&mdash;while
they lay safe in that locked room, and Tignonville crouched in his haymow&mdash;Huguenots
less fortunate were being cast, bound hand and foot, into the Seine.&nbsp;
On the river bank Spire Niquet, the bookman, was being burnt over a
slow fire, fed with his own books.&nbsp; In their houses, Ramus the
scholar and Goujon the sculptor&mdash;than whom Paris has neither seen
nor deserved a greater&mdash;were being butchered like sheep; and in
the Valley of Misery, now the Quai de la Megisserie, seven hundred persons
who had sought refuge in the prisons were being beaten to death with
bludgeons.&nbsp; Nay, at this hour&mdash;a little sooner or a little
later, what matters it?&mdash;M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s own cousin,
Madame d&rsquo;Yverne, the darling of the Louvre the day before, perished
in the hands of the mob; and the sister of M. de Taverny, equally ill-fated,
died in the same fashion, after being dragged through the streets.</p>
<p>Madame Carlat, then, went not a whit beyond the mark in her argument.&nbsp;
But Mademoiselle had made up her mind, and was not to be dissuaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am to be Monsieur&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; she said with
quivering nostrils, &ldquo;shall I fear his servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And opening the door herself, for the others would not, she called.&nbsp;
The man who answered was a Norman; and short of stature, and wrinkled
and low-browed of feature, with a thatch of hair and a full beard, he
seemed the embodiment of the women&rsquo;s apprehensions.&nbsp; Moreover,
his <i>patois</i> of the cider-land was little better than German to
them; their southern, softer tongue was sheer Italian to him.&nbsp;
But he seemed not ill-disposed, or Mademoiselle&rsquo;s air overawed
him; and presently she made him understand, and with a nod he descended
to carry her message.</p>
<p>Then Mademoiselle&rsquo;s heart began to beat; and beat more quickly
when she heard <i>his</i> step&mdash;alas! she knew it already, knew
it from all others&mdash;on the stairs.&nbsp; The table was set, the
card must be played, to win or lose.&nbsp; It might be that with the
low opinion he held of women he would think her reconciled to her lot;
he would think this an overture, a step towards kinder treatment, one
more proof of the inconstancy of the lower and the weaker sex, made
to be men&rsquo;s playthings.&nbsp; And at that thought her eyes grew
hot with rage.&nbsp; But if it were so, she must still put up with it.&nbsp;
She must still put up with it!&nbsp; She had sent for him, and he was
coming&mdash;he was at the door!</p>
<p>He entered, and she breathed more freely.&nbsp; For once his face
lacked the sneer, the look of smiling possession, which she had come
to know and hate.&nbsp; It was grave, expectant, even suspicious; still
harsh and dark, akin, as she now observed, to the low-browed, furrowed
face of the rider who had summoned him.&nbsp; But the offensive look
was gone, and she could breathe.</p>
<p>He closed the door behind him, but he did not advance into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your pleasure, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he said simply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You sent for me, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on her feet, standing before him with something of the submissiveness
of Roxana before her conqueror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she said; and stopped at that, her hand to her
side as if she could not continue.&nbsp; But presently in a low voice,
&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;what you said, Monsieur,
after I lost consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said; and was silent.&nbsp; Nor did he lose
his watchful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to you for your thought of me,&rdquo; she continued
in a faint voice, &ldquo;and I shall be still further obliged&mdash;I
speak to you thus quickly and thus early&mdash;if you will grant me
a somewhat longer time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;if I will postpone our marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; she cried, raising her voice impulsively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I appeal to your generosity.&nbsp; And for a short, a very short,
time only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; he answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
for reasons, Mademoiselle.&nbsp; In the first place, I can more easily
protect my wife.&nbsp; In the second, I am even now summoned to the
Louvre, and should be on my way thither.&nbsp; By to-morrow evening,
unless I am mistaken in the business on which I am required, I shall
be on my way to a distant province with royal letters.&nbsp; It is essential
that our marriage take place before I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked stubbornly.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can you ask, Mademoiselle, after the events of last night?&nbsp;
Because, if you please, I do not wish to share the fate of M. de Tignonville.&nbsp;
Because in these days life is uncertain, and death too certain.&nbsp;
Because it was our turn last night, and it may be the turn of your friends&mdash;to-morrow
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then some have escaped?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>He smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad to find you so shrewd,&rdquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;In an honest wife it is an excellent quality.&nbsp;
Yes, Mademoiselle; one or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; I pray you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Montgomery, who slept beyond the river, for one; and
the Vidame, and some with him.&nbsp; M. de Biron, whom I count a Huguenot,
and who holds the Arsenal in the King&rsquo;s teeth, for another.&nbsp;
And a few more.&nbsp; Enough, in a word, Mademoiselle, to keep us wakeful.&nbsp;
It is impossible, therefore, for me to postpone the fulfilment of your
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A promise on conditions!&rdquo; she retorted, in rage that
she could win no more.&nbsp; And every line of her splendid figure,
every tone of her voice flamed sudden, hot rebellion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not go for nothing!&nbsp; You gave me the lives of all in the house,
Monsieur!&nbsp; Of all!&rdquo; she repeated with passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
all are not here!&nbsp; Before I marry you, you must show me M. de Tignonville
alive and safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has taken himself off,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is naught to me what happens to him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all to me!&rdquo; she retorted.</p>
<p>At that he glared at her, the veins of his forehead swelling suddenly.&nbsp;
But after a seeming struggle with himself he put the insult by, perhaps
for future reckoning and account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did what I could,&rdquo; he said sullenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had
I willed it he had died there and then in the room below.&nbsp; I gave
him his life.&nbsp; If he has risked it anew and lost it, it is naught
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his life you gave me,&rdquo; she repeated stubbornly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His life&mdash;and the others.&nbsp; But that is not all,&rdquo;
she continued; &ldquo;you promised me a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, smiling sourly to himself, as if this confirmed a suspicion
he had entertained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a priest,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If one could be obtained.&nbsp; If not, a priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was to be at my will; and I will a minister!&nbsp;
I will a minister!&rdquo; she cried passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show
me M. de Tignonville alive, and bring me a minister of my faith, and
I will keep my promise, M. de Tavannes.&nbsp; Have no fear of that.&nbsp;
But otherwise, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment she had said it fear seized her, and she could have fled
from him, screaming.&nbsp; The flash of his eyes, the sudden passion
of his face, burned themselves into her memory.&nbsp; She thought for
a second that he would spring on her and strike her down.&nbsp; Yet
though the women behind her held their breath, she faced him, and did
not quail; and to that, she fancied, she owed it that he controlled
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not?&rdquo; he repeated, as if he could not understand
such resistance to his will&mdash;as if he could not credit his ears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will not?&rdquo;&nbsp; But after that, when he had said it
three times, he laughed; a laugh, however, with a snarl in it that chilled
her blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bargain, do you?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will
have the last tittle of the price, will you?&nbsp; And have thought
of this and that to put me off, and to gain time until your lover, who
is all to you, comes to save you?&nbsp; Oh, clever girl! clever!&nbsp;
But have you thought where you stand&mdash;woman?&nbsp; Do you know
that if I gave the word to my people they would treat you as the commonest
baggage that tramps the Froidmantel?&nbsp; Do you know that it rests
with me to save you, or to throw you to the wolves whose ravening you
hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pointed to the window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minister?&nbsp;
Priest?&rdquo; he continued grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Mademoiselle,
I stand astonished at my moderation.&nbsp; You chatter to me of ministers
and priests, and the one or the other, when it might be neither!&nbsp;
When you are as much and as hopelessly in my power to-day as the wench
in my kitchen!&nbsp; You!&nbsp; You flout me, and make terms with me!&nbsp;
You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he came so near her with his dark harsh face, his tone rose so
menacing on the last word, that her nerves, shattered before, gave way,
and, unable to control herself, she flinched with a low cry, thinking
he would strike her.</p>
<p>He did not follow, nor move to follow; but he laughed a low laugh
of content.&nbsp; And his eyes devoured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not so brave as
we pretend to be, it seems.&nbsp; And yet you dared to chaffer with
me?&nbsp; You thought to thwart me&mdash;Tavannes!&nbsp; <i>Mon Dieu</i>,
Mademoiselle, to what did you trust?&nbsp; To what did you trust?&nbsp;
Ay, and to what do you trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew that by the movement which fear had forced from her she
had jeopardized everything.&nbsp; That she stood to lose all and more
than all which she had thought to win by a bold front.&nbsp; A woman
less brave, of a spirit less firm, would have given up the contest,
and have been glad to escape so.&nbsp; But this woman, though her bloodless
face showed that she knew what cause she had for fear, and though her
heart was indeed sick with terror, held her ground at the point to which
she had retreated.&nbsp; She played her last card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what do I trust?&rdquo; she muttered with trembling lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he answered between his teeth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To what do you trust&mdash;that you play with Tavannes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To his honour, Monsieur,&rdquo; she answered faintly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And to your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with his mocking smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo;
he sneered, &ldquo;you thought a moment ago that I should strike you.&nbsp;
You thought that I should beat you!&nbsp; And now it is my honour and
my promise!&nbsp; Oh, clever, clever, Mademoiselle!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
so that women make fools of men.&nbsp; I knew that something of this
kind was on foot when you sent for me, for I know women and their ways.&nbsp;
But, let me tell you, it is an ill time to speak of honour when the
streets are red!&nbsp; And of promises when the King&rsquo;s word is
&lsquo;No faith with a heretic!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you will keep yours,&rdquo; she said bravely.</p>
<p>He did not answer at once, and hope which was almost dead in her
breast began to recover; nay, presently sprang up erect.&nbsp; For the
man hesitated, it was evident; he brooded with a puckered brow and gloomy
eyes; an observer might have fancied that he traced pain as well as
doubt in his face.&nbsp; At last&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a thing,&rdquo; he said slowly and with a sort of
glare at her, &ldquo;which, it may be, you have not reckoned.&nbsp;
You press me now, and will stand on your terms and your conditions,
your <i>ifs</i> and your <i>unlesses</i>!&nbsp; You will have the most
from me, and the bargain and a little beside the bargain!&nbsp; But
I would have you think if you are wise.&nbsp; Bethink you how it will
be between us when you are my wife&mdash;if you press me so now, Mademoiselle.&nbsp;
How will it sweeten things then?&nbsp; How will it soften them?&nbsp;
And to what, I pray you, will you trust for fair treatment then, if
you will be so against me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the mercy of my husband,&rdquo; she
said in a low voice.&nbsp; And her chin sank on her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be content to trust to that?&rdquo; he answered grimly.&nbsp;
And his tone and the lifting of his brow promised little clemency.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bethink you!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis your rights now, and your terms,
Mademoiselle!&nbsp; And then it will be only my mercy&mdash;Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am content,&rdquo; she muttered faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Lord have mercy on my soul, is what you would add,&rdquo;
he retorted, &ldquo;so much trust have you in my mercy!&nbsp; And you
are right!&nbsp; You are right, since you have played this trick on
me.&nbsp; But as you will.&nbsp; If you will have it so, have it so!&nbsp;
You shall stand on your conditions now; you shall have your pennyweight
and full advantage, and the rigour of the pact.&nbsp; But afterwards&mdash;afterwards,
Madame de Tavannes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish his sentence, for at the first word which granted
her petition, Mademoiselle had sunk down on the low wooden window-seat
beside which she stood, and, cowering into its farthest corner, her
face hidden on her arms, had burst into violent weeping.&nbsp; Her hair,
hastily knotted up in the hurry of the previous night, hung in a thick
plait to the curve of her waist; the nape of her neck showed beside
it milk-white.&nbsp; The man stood awhile contemplating her in silence,
his gloomy eyes watching the pitiful movement of her shoulders, the
convulsive heaving of her figure.&nbsp; But he did not offer to touch
her, and at length he turned about.&nbsp; First one and then the other
of her women quailed and shrank under his gaze; he seemed about to add
something.&nbsp; But he did not speak.&nbsp; The sentence he had left
unfinished, the long look he bent on the weeping girl as he turned from
her, spoke more eloquently of the future than a score of orations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Afterwards, Madame de Tavannes</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; IN THE HALL OF THE LOUVRE.</h2>
<p>It is a strange thing that love&mdash;or passion, if the sudden fancy
for Mademoiselle which had seized Count Hannibal be deemed unworthy
of the higher name&mdash;should so entirely possess the souls of those
who harbour it that the greatest events and the most astounding catastrophes,
even measures which set their mark for all time on a nation, are to
them of importance only so far as they affect the pursuit of the fair
one.</p>
<p>As Tavannes, after leaving Mademoiselle, rode through the paved lanes,
beneath the gabled houses, and under the shadow of the Gothic spires
of his day, he saw a score of sights, moving to pity, or wrath, or wonder.&nbsp;
He saw Paris as a city sacked; a slaughter-house, where for a week a
masque had moved to stately music; blood on the nailed doors and the
close-set window bars; and at the corners of the ways strewn garments,
broken weapons, the livid dead in heaps.&nbsp; But he saw all with eyes
which in all and everywhere, among living and dead, sought only Tignonville;
Tignonville first, and next a heretic minister, with enough of life
in him to do his office.</p>
<p>Probably it was to this that one man hunted through Paris owed his
escape that day.&nbsp; He sprang from a narrow passage full in Tavannes&rsquo;
view, and, hair on end, his eyes starting from his head, ran blindly&mdash;as
a hare will run when chased&mdash;along the street to meet Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
company.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s face was wet with the dews of death,
his lungs seemed cracking, his breath hissed from him as he ran.&nbsp;
His pursuers were hard on him, and, seeing him headed by Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
party, yelled in triumph, holding him for dead.&nbsp; And dead he would
have been within thirty seconds had Tavannes played his part.&nbsp;
But his thoughts were elsewhere.&nbsp; Either he took the poor wretch
for Tignonville, or for the minister on whom his mind was running; anyway
he suffered him to slip under the belly of his horse; then, to make
matters worse, he wheeled to follow him in so untimely and clumsy a
fashion that his horse blocked the way and stopped the pursuers in their
tracks.&nbsp; The quarry slipped into an alley and vanished.&nbsp; The
hunters stood and blasphemed, and even for a moment seemed inclined
to resent the mistake.&nbsp; But Tavannes smiled; a broader smile lightened
the faces of the six iron-clad men behind him; and for some reason the
gang of ruffians thought better of it and slunk aside.</p>
<p>There are hard men, who feel scorn of the things which in the breasts
of others excite pity.&nbsp; Tavannes&rsquo; lip curled as he rode on
through the streets, looking this way and that, and seeing what a King
twenty-two years old had made of his capital.&nbsp; His lip curled most
of all when he came, passing between the two tennis-courts, to the east
gate of the Louvre, and found the entrance locked and guarded, and all
communication between city and palace cut off.&nbsp; Such a proof of
unkingly panic, in a crisis wrought by the King himself, astonished
him less a few minutes later, when, the keys having been brought and
the door opened, he entered the courtyard of the fortress.</p>
<p>Within and about the door of the gatehouse some three-score archers
and arquebusiers stood to their arms; not in array, but in disorderly
groups, from which the babble of voices, of feverish laughter, and strained
jests rose without ceasing.&nbsp; The weltering sun, of which the beams
just topped the farther side of the quadrangle, fell slantwise on their
armour, and heightened their exaggerated and restless movements.&nbsp;
To a calm eye they seemed like men acting in a nightmare.&nbsp; Their
fitful talk and disjointed gestures, their sweating brows and damp hair,
no less than the sullen, brooding silence of one here and there, bespoke
the abnormal and the terrible.&nbsp; There were livid faces among them,
and twitching cheeks, and some who swallowed much; and some again who
bared their crimson arms and bragged insanely of the part they had played.&nbsp;
But perhaps the most striking thing was the thirst, the desire, the
demand for news, and for fresh excitement.&nbsp; In the space of time
it took him to pass through them, Count Hannibal heard a dozen rumours
of what was passing in the city; that Montgomery and the gentlemen who
had slept beyond the river had escaped on horseback in their shirts;
that Guise had been shot in the pursuit; that he had captured the Vidame
de Chartres and all the fugitives; that he had never left the city;
that he was even then entering by the Porte de Bucy.&nbsp; Again that
Biron had surrendered the Arsenal, that he had threatened to fire on
the city, that he was dead, that with the Huguenots who had escaped
he was marching on the Louvre, that&mdash;</p>
<p>And then Tavannes passed out of the blinding sunshine, and out of
earshot of their babble, and had plain in his sight across the quadrangle,
the new fa&ccedil;ade, Italian, graceful, of the Renaissance; which
rose in smiling contrast with the three dark Gothic sides that now,
the central tower removed, frowned unimpeded at one another.&nbsp; But
what was this which lay along the foot of the new Italian wall?&nbsp;
This, round which some stood, gazing curiously, while others strewed
fresh sand about it, or after long downward-looking glanced up to answer
the question of a person at a window?</p>
<p>Death; and over death&mdash;death in its most cruel aspect&mdash;a
cloud of buzzing, whirling flies, and the smell, never to be forgotten,
of much spilled blood.&nbsp; From a doorway hard by came shrill bursts
of hysterical laughter; and with the laughter plumped out, even as Tavannes
crossed the court, a young girl, thrust forth it seemed by her fellows,
for she turned about and struggled as she came.&nbsp; Once outside she
hung back, giggling and protesting, half willing, half unwilling; and
meeting Tavannes&rsquo; eye thrust her way in again with a whirl of
her petticoats, and a shriek.&nbsp; But before he had taken four paces
she was out again.</p>
<p>He paused to see who she was, and his thoughts involuntarily went
back to the woman he had left weeping in the upper room.&nbsp; Then
he turned about again and stood to count the dead.&nbsp; He identified
Piles, identified Pardaillan, identified Soubise&mdash;whose corpse
the murderers had robbed of the last rag&mdash;and Touchet and St. Galais.&nbsp;
He made his reckoning with an unmoved face, and with the same face stopped
and stared, and moved from one to another; had he not seen the slaughter
about &ldquo;<i>le petit homme</i>&rdquo; at Jarnac, and the dead of
three pitched fields?&nbsp; But when a bystander, smirking obsequiously,
passed him a jest on Soubise, and with his finger pointed the jest,
he had the same hard unmoved face for the gibe as for the dead.&nbsp;
And the jester shrank away, abashed and perplexed by his stare and his
reticence.</p>
<p>Halfway up the staircase to the great gallery or guard-room above,
Count Hannibal found his brother, the Marshal, huddled together in drunken
slumber on a seat in a recess.&nbsp; In the gallery to which he passed
on without awakening him, a crowd of courtiers and ladies, with arquebusiers
and captains of the quarters, walked to and fro, talking in whispers;
or peeped over shoulders towards the inner end of the hall, where the
querulous voice of the King rose now and again above the hum.&nbsp;
As Tavannes moved that way, Nan&ccedil;ay, in the act of passing out,
booted and armed for the road, met him and almost jostled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well met, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he sneered, with as much
hostility as he dared betray.&nbsp; &ldquo;The King has asked for you
twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to him.&nbsp; And you?&nbsp; Whither in such a
hurry, M. Nan&ccedil;ay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Chatillon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On pleasant business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough that it is on the King&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Nan&ccedil;ay
replied, with unexpected temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope that you may find
yours as pleasant!&rdquo; he added with a grin.&nbsp; And he went on.</p>
<p>The gleam of malice in the man&rsquo;s eye warned Tavannes to pause.&nbsp;
He looked round for some one who might be in the secret, saw the Provost
of the Merchants, and approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amiss, M. le Charron?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is not the affair going as it should?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis about the Arsenal, M. le Comte,&rdquo; the Provost
answered busily.&nbsp; &ldquo;M. de Biron is harbouring the vermin there.&nbsp;
He has lowered the portcullis and pointed his culverins over the gate
and will not yield it or listen to reason.&nbsp; The King would bring
him to terms, but no one will venture himself inside with the message.&nbsp;
Rats in a trap, you know, bite hard, and care little whom they bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely, M. le Comte.&nbsp; His Majesty would have sent
M. de Nan&ccedil;ay.&nbsp; But he elected to go to Chatillon, to seize
the young brood there.&nbsp; The Admiral&rsquo;s children, you comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose teeth are not yet grown!&nbsp; He was wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, M. de Tavannes, to be sure.&nbsp; But the King
was annoyed, and on top of that came a priest with complaints, and if
I may make so bold as to advise you, you will not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tavannes fancied that he had caught the gist of the difficulty,
and with a nod he moved on; and so he missed the warning which the other
had it in his mind to give.&nbsp; A moment and he reached the inner
circle, and there halted, disconcerted, nay taken aback.&nbsp; For as
soon as he showed his face, the King, who was pacing to and fro like
a caged beast, before a table at which three clerks knelt on cushions,
espied him, and stood still.&nbsp; With a glare of something like madness
in his eyes, Charles raised his hand, and with a shaking finger singled
him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, by G-d, you are there!&rdquo; he cried, with a volley
of blasphemy.&nbsp; And he signed to those about Count Hannibal to stand
away from him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are there, are you?&nbsp; And you are
not afraid to show your face?&nbsp; I tell you, it&rsquo;s you and such
as you bring us into contempt! so that it is said everywhere Guise does
all and serves God, and we follow because we must!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
you, and such as you, are stumbling-blocks to our good folk of Paris!&nbsp;
Are you traitor, sirrah?&rdquo; he continued with passion, &ldquo;or
are you of our brother Alen&ccedil;on&rsquo;s opinions, that you traverse
our orders to the damnation of your soul and our discredit?&nbsp; Are
you traitor?&nbsp; Or are you heretic?&nbsp; Or what are you?&nbsp;
God in heaven, will you answer me, man, or shall I send you where you
will find your tongue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not of what your Majesty accuses me,&rdquo; Count Hannibal
answered, with a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not I,&rdquo; the King retorted.&nbsp;
His hair hung damp on his brow, and he dried his hands continually;
while his gestures had the ill-measured and eccentric violence of an
epileptic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, you!&nbsp; Speak, father, and confound
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Tavannes discovered on the farther side of the circle the priest
whom his brother had ridden down that morning.&nbsp; Father Pezelay&rsquo;s
pale hatchet-face gleamed paler than ordinary; and a great bandage hid
one temple and part of his face.&nbsp; But below the bandage the flame
of his eyes was not lessened, nor the venom of his tongue.&nbsp; To
the King he had come&mdash;for no other would deal with his violent
opponent; to the King&rsquo;s presence! and, as he prepared to blast
his adversary, now his chance was come, his long lean frame, in its
narrow black cassock, seemed to grow longer, leaner, more baleful, more
snake-like.&nbsp; He stood there a fitting representative of the dark
fanaticism of Paris, which Charles and his successor&mdash;the last
of a doomed line&mdash;alternately used as tool or feared as master;
and to which the most debased and the most immoral of courts paid, in
its sober hours, a vile and slavish homage.&nbsp; Even in the midst
of the drunken, shameless courtiers&mdash;who stood, if they stood for
anything, for that other influence of the day, the Renaissance&mdash;he
was to be reckoned with; and Count Hannibal knew it.&nbsp; He knew that
in the eyes not of Charles only, but of nine out of ten who listened
to him, a priest was more sacred than a virgin, and a tonsure than all
the virtues of spotless innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall the King give with one hand and withdraw with the other?&rdquo;
the priest began, in a voice hoarse yet strident, a voice borne high
above the crowd on the wings of passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall he spare
of the best of the men and the maidens whom God hath doomed, whom the
Church hath devoted, whom the King hath given?&nbsp; Is the King&rsquo;s
hand shortened or his word annulled that a man does as he forbiddeth
and leaves undone what he commandeth?&nbsp; Is God mocked?&nbsp; Woe,
woe unto you,&rdquo; he continued, turning swiftly, arms uplifted, towards
Tavannes, &ldquo;who please yourself with the red and white of their
maidens and take of the best of the spoil, sparing where the King&rsquo;s
word is &lsquo;Spare not&rsquo;!&nbsp; Who strike at Holy Church with
the sword!&nbsp; Who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer, sirrah!&rdquo; Charles cried, spurning the floor in
his fury.&nbsp; He could not listen long to any man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it so?&nbsp; Is it so?&nbsp; Do you do these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal shrugged his shoulders and was about to answer, when
a thick, drunken voice rose from the crowd behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it what?&nbsp; Eh!&nbsp; Is it what?&rdquo; it droned.&nbsp;
And a figure with bloodshot eyes, disordered beard, and rich clothes
awry, forced its way through the obsequious circle.&nbsp; It was Marshal
Tavannes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh, what?&nbsp; You&rsquo;d beard the King, would
you?&rdquo; he hiccoughed truculently, his eyes on Father Pezelay, his
hand on his sword.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you a priest ten times&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Charles cried, almost foaming with rage at
this fresh interruption.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not he, fool!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis your pestilent brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who touches my brother touches Tavannes!&rdquo; the Marshal
answered with a menacing gesture.&nbsp; He was sober enough, it appeared,
to hear what was said, but not to comprehend its drift; and this caused
a titter, which immediately excited his rage.&nbsp; He turned and seized
the nearest laugher by the ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Insolent!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will teach you to laugh when the King speaks!&nbsp; Puppy!&nbsp;
Who laughs at his Majesty or touches my brother has to do with Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, in a rage that almost deprived him of speech, stamped the
floor twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imbecile!&nbsp; Let the
man go!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not he!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis your heretic brother,
I tell you!&nbsp; By all the Saints!&nbsp; By the body of&mdash;&rdquo;
and he poured forth a flood of oaths.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you listen to
me and be silent!&nbsp; Will you&mdash;your brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he be not your Majesty&rsquo;s servant, I will kill him
with this sword!&rdquo; the irrepressible Marshal struck in.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
I have killed ten to-day!&nbsp; Ten!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, staggering back,
he only saved himself from falling by clutching Chicot about the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, my pretty Mar&eacute;chale!&rdquo; the jester cried,
chucking him under the chin with one hand, while with some difficulty
he supported him with the other&mdash;for he, too, was far from sober&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pretty Margot, toy with me,<br />
Maiden bashful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Charles cried, darting forth his long arms
in a fury of impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;God, have I killed every man of
sense?&nbsp; Are you all gone mad?&nbsp; Silence!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp;
Silence!&nbsp; And let me hear what he has to say,&rdquo; with a movement
towards Count Hannibal.&nbsp; &ldquo;And look you, sirrah,&rdquo; he
continued with a curse, &ldquo;see that it be to the purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be a question of your Majesty&rsquo;s service,&rdquo;
Tavannes answered, &ldquo;and obedience to your Majesty&rsquo;s orders,
I am deeper in it than he who stands there!&rdquo; with a sign towards
the priest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give my word for that.&nbsp; And I will prove
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; Charles cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;How, how, how?&nbsp;
How will you prove it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By doing for you, sire, what he will not do!&rdquo; Tavannes
answered scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him stand out, and if he will
serve his Church as I will serve my King&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blaspheme not!&rdquo; cried the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chatter not!&rdquo; Tavannes retorted hardily, &ldquo;but
do!&nbsp; Better is he,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;who takes a city
than he who slays women!&nbsp; Nay, sire,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly,
seeing the King start, &ldquo;be not angry, but hear me!&nbsp; You would
send to Biron, to the Arsenal?&nbsp; You seek a messenger, sire?&nbsp;
Then let the good father be the man.&nbsp; Let him take your Majesty&rsquo;s
will to Biron, and let him see the Grand Master face to face, and bring
him to reason.&nbsp; Or, if he will not, I will!&nbsp; Let that be the
test!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; cried Marshal de Tavannes, &ldquo;you say well,
brother!&nbsp; Let him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he will not, I will!&rdquo; Tavannes repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let that be the test, sire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King wheeled suddenly to Father Pezelay.&nbsp; &ldquo;You hear,
father?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What say you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest&rsquo;s face grew sallow, and more sallow.&nbsp; He knew
that the walls of the Arsenal sheltered men whose hands no convention
and no order of Biron&rsquo;s would keep from his throat, were the grim
gate and frowning culverins once passed; men who had seen their women
and children, their wives and sisters immolated at his word, and now
asked naught but to stand face to face and eye to eye with him and tear
him limb from limb before they died!&nbsp; The challenge, therefore,
was one-sided and unfair; but for that very reason it shook him.&nbsp;
The astuteness of the man who, taken by surprise, had conceived this
snare filled him with dread.&nbsp; He dared not accept, and he scarcely
dared to refuse the offer.&nbsp; And meantime the eyes of the courtiers,
who grinned in their beards, were on him.&nbsp; At length he spoke,
but it was in a voice which had lost its boldness and assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for me to clear myself,&rdquo; he cried, shrill
and violent, &ldquo;but for those who are accused, for those who have
belied the King&rsquo;s word, and set at nought his Christian orders.&nbsp;
For you, Count Hannibal, heretic, or no better than heretic, it is easy
to say &lsquo;I go.&rsquo;&nbsp; For you go but to your own, and your
own will receive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will not go?&rdquo; with a jeer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your command?&nbsp; No!&rdquo; the priest shrieked with
passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;His Majesty knows whether I serve him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Charles cried, stamping his foot in a fury,
&ldquo;that you all serve me when it pleases you!&nbsp; That you are
all sticks of the same faggot, wood of the same bundle, hell-babes in
your own business, and sluggards in mine!&nbsp; You kill to-day and
you&rsquo;ll lay it to me to-morrow!&nbsp; Ay, you will! you will!&rdquo;
he repeated frantically, and drove home the asseveration with a fearful
oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dead are as good servants as you!&nbsp; Foucauld
was better!&nbsp; Foucauld?&nbsp; Foucauld?&nbsp; Ah, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And abruptly in presence of them all, with the sacred name, which
he so often defiled, on his lips, Charles turned, and covering his face
burst into childish weeping; while a great silence fell on all&mdash;on
Bussy with the blood of his cousin Resnel on his point, on Fervacques,
the betrayer of his friend, on Chicot, the slayer of his rival, on Cocconnas
the cruel&mdash;on men with hands unwashed from the slaughter, and on
the shameless women who lined the walls; on all who used this sobbing
man for their stepping-stone, and, to attain their ends and gain their
purposes, trampled his dull soul in blood and mire.</p>
<p>One looked at another in consternation.&nbsp; Fear grew in eyes that
a moment before were bold; cheeks turned pale that a moment before were
hectic.&nbsp; If <i>he</i> changed as rapidly as this, if so little
dependence could be placed on his moods or his resolutions, who was
safe?&nbsp; Whose turn might it not be to-morrow?&nbsp; Or who might
not be held accountable for the deeds done this day?&nbsp; Many, from
whom remorse had seemed far distant a while before, shuddered and glanced
behind them.&nbsp; It was as if the dead who lay stark without the doors,
ay, and the countless dead of Paris, with whose shrieks the air was
laden, had flocked in shadowy shape into the hall; and there, standing
beside their murderers, had whispered with their cold breath in the
living ears, &ldquo;A reckoning!&nbsp; A reckoning!&nbsp; As I am, thou
shalt be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Count Hannibal who broke the spell and the silence, and with
his hand on his brother&rsquo;s shoulder stood forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, sire,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice which rang defiant
in the roof, and seemed to challenge alike the living and the dead,
&ldquo;if all deny the deed, yet will not I!&nbsp; What we have done
we have done!&nbsp; So be it!&nbsp; The dead are dead!&nbsp; So be it!&nbsp;
For the rest, your Majesty has still one servant who will do your will,
one soldier whose life is at your disposition!&nbsp; I have said I will
go, and I go, sire.&nbsp; And you, churchman,&rdquo; he continued, turning
in bitter scorn to the priest, &ldquo;do you go too&mdash;to church!&nbsp;
To church, shaveling!&nbsp; Go, watch and pray for us!&nbsp; Fast and
flog for us!&nbsp; Whip those shoulders, whip them till the blood runs
down!&nbsp; For it is all, it seems, you will do for your King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles turned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence, railer!&rdquo; he said in a
broken voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sow no more troubles!&nbsp; Already,&rdquo;
a shudder shook his tall ungainly form, &ldquo;I see blood, blood, blood
everywhere!&nbsp; Blood?&nbsp; Ah, God, shall I from this time see anything
else?&nbsp; But there is no turning back.&nbsp; There is no undoing.&nbsp;
So, do you go to Biron.&nbsp; And do you,&rdquo; he went on, sullenly
addressing Marshal Tavannes, &ldquo;take him and tell him what it is
needful he should know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis done, sire!&rdquo; the Marshal cried, with a hiccough.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the two, the courtiers making quick way for them, had passed
down the hall to the door, the Marshal tapped Hannibal&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was touch and go,&rdquo; he muttered; it was plain he had
been more sober than he seemed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind you, it does not do
to thwart our little master in his fits!&nbsp; Remember that another
time, or worse will come of it, brother.&nbsp; As it is, you came out
of it finely and tripped that black devil&rsquo;s heels to a marvel!&nbsp;
But you won&rsquo;t be so mad as to go to Biron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not!&nbsp; Better not!&rdquo; the Marshal answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be easier to go in than to come out&mdash;with a
whole throat!&nbsp; Have you taken wild cats in the hollow of a tree?&nbsp;
The young first, and then the she-cat?&nbsp; Well, it will be that!&nbsp;
Take my advice, brother.&nbsp; Have after Montgomery, if you please,
ride with Nan&ccedil;ay to Chatillon&mdash;he is mounting now&mdash;go
where you please out of Paris, but don&rsquo;t go there!&nbsp; Biron
hates us, hates me.&nbsp; And for the King, if he do not see you for
a few days, &rsquo;twill blow over in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I shall go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marshal stared a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Morbleu!&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;why?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not to please the King, I know.&nbsp; What
do you think to find there, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister,&rdquo; Hannibal answered gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
want one with life in him, and they are scarce in the open.&nbsp; So
I must to covert after him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, twitching his sword-belt
a little nearer to his hand, he passed across the court to the gate,
and to his horses.</p>
<p>The Marshal went back laughing, and, slapping his thigh as he entered
the hall, jostled by accident a gentleman who was passing out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the Gascon cried hotly; for it was Chicot
he had jostled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who touches my brother touches Tavannes!&rdquo; the Marshal
hiccoughed.&nbsp; And, smiting his thigh anew, he went off into another
fit of laughter.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; DIPLOMACY.</h2>
<p>Where the old wall of Paris, of which no vestige remains, ran down
on the east to the north bank of the river, the space in the angle between
the Seine and the ramparts beyond the Rue St. Pol wore at this date
an aspect typical of the troubles of the time.&nbsp; Along the waterside
the gloomy old Palace of St. Pol, once the residence of the mad King
Charles the Sixth&mdash;and his wife, the abandoned Isabeau de Bavi&egrave;re&mdash;sprawled
its maze of mouldering courts and ruined galleries; a dreary monument
of the Gothic days which were passing from France.&nbsp; Its spacious
curtilage and dark pleasaunces covered all the ground between the river
and the Rue St. Antoine; and north of this, under the shadow of the
eight great towers of the Bastille, which looked, four outward to check
the stranger, four inward to bridle the town, a second palace, beginning
where St. Pol ended, carried the realm of decay to the city wall.</p>
<p>This second palace was the H&ocirc;tel des Tournelles, a fantastic
medley of turrets, spires, and gables, that equally with its neighbour
recalled the days of the English domination; it had been the abode of
the Regent Bedford.&nbsp; From his time it had remained for a hundred
years the town residence of the kings of France; but the death of Henry
II., slain in its lists by the lance of the same Montgomery who was
this day fleeing for his life before Guise, had given his widow a distaste
for it.&nbsp; Catherine de M&eacute;dicis, her sons, and the Court had
abandoned it; already its gardens lay a tangled wilderness, its roofs
let in the rain, rats played where kings had slept; and in &ldquo;our
palace of the Tournelles&rdquo; reigned only silence and decay.&nbsp;
Unless, indeed, as was whispered abroad, the grim shade of the eleventh
Louis sometimes walked in its desolate precincts.</p>
<p>In the innermost angle between the ramparts and the river, shut off
from the rest of Paris by the decaying courts and enceintes of these
forsaken palaces, stood the Arsenal.&nbsp; Destroyed in great part by
the explosion of a powder-mill a few years earlier, it was in the main
new; and by reason of its river frontage, which terminated at the ruined
tower of Billy, and its proximity to the Bastille, it was esteemed one
of the keys of Paris.&nbsp; It was the appanage of the Master of the
Ordnance, and within its walls M. de Biron, a Huguenot in politics,
if not in creed, who held the office at this time, had secured himself
on the first alarm.&nbsp; During the day he had admitted a number of
refugees, whose courage or good luck had led them to his gate; and as
night fell&mdash;on such a carnage as the hapless city had not beheld
since the great slaughter of the Armagnacs, one hundred and fifty-four
years earlier&mdash;the glow of his matches through the dusk, and the
sullen tramp of his watchmen as they paced the walls, indicated that
there was still one place in Paris where the King&rsquo;s will did not
run.</p>
<p>In comparison of the disorder which prevailed in the city, a deadly
quiet reigned here; a stillness so chill that a timid man must have
stood and hesitated to approach.&nbsp; But a stranger who about nightfall
rode down the street towards the entrance, a single footman running
at his stirrup, only nodded a stern approval of the preparations.&nbsp;
As he drew nearer he cast an attentive eye this way and that; nor stayed
until a hoarse challenge brought him up when he had come within six
horses&rsquo; lengths of the Arsenal gate.&nbsp; He reined up then,
and raising his voice, asked in clear tones for M. de Biron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he continued boldly, &ldquo;tell the Grand Master
that one from the King is here, and would speak with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the King of France?&rdquo; the officer on the gate asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely!&nbsp; Is there more than one king in France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A curse and a bitter cry of &ldquo;King?&nbsp; King Herod!&rdquo;
were followed by a muttered discussion that, in the ears of one of the
two who waited in the gloom below, boded little good.&nbsp; The two
could descry figures moving to and fro before the faint red light of
the smouldering matches; and presently a man on the gate kindled a torch,
and held it so as to fling its light downward.&nbsp; The stranger&rsquo;s
attendant cowered behind the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, my lord!&rdquo; he whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are aiming at us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If so the rider&rsquo;s bold front and unmoved demeanour gave them
pause.&nbsp; Presently, &ldquo;I will send for the Grand Master&rdquo;
the man who had spoken before announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;In whose name,
monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; the stranger answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say,
one from the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall enter alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assurance seemed to be satisfactory, for the man answered &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
and after a brief delay a wicket in the gate was opened, the portcullis
creaked upward, and a plank was thrust across the ditch.&nbsp; The horseman
waited until the preparations were complete; then he slid to the ground,
threw his rein to the servant, and boldly walked across.&nbsp; In an
instant he left behind him the dark street, the river, and the sounds
of outrage, which the night breeze bore from the farther bank, and found
himself within the vaulted gateway, in a bright glare of light, the
centre of a ring of gleaming eyes and angry faces.</p>
<p>The light blinded him for a few seconds; but the guards, on their
side, were in no better case.&nbsp; For the stranger was masked; and
in their ignorance who it was looked at them through the slits in the
black velvet they stared, disconcerted, and at a loss.&nbsp; There were
some there with naked weapons in their hands who would have struck him
through had they known who he was; and more who would have stood aside
while the deed was done.&nbsp; But the uncertainty&mdash;that and the
masked man&rsquo;s tone paralyzed them.&nbsp; For they reflected that
he might be anyone.&nbsp; Cond&eacute;, indeed, stood too small, but
Navarre, if he lived, might fill that cloak; or Guise, or Anjou, or
the King himself.&nbsp; And while some would not have scrupled to strike
the blood royal, more would have been quick to protect and avenge it.&nbsp;
And so before the dark uncertainty of the mask, before the riddle of
the smiling eyes which glittered through the slits, they stared irresolute;
until a hand, the hand of one bolder than his fellows, was raised to
pluck away the screen.</p>
<p>The unknown dealt the fellow a buffet with his fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down,
rascal!&rdquo; he said hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&rdquo;&mdash;to
the officer&mdash;&ldquo;show me instantly to M. de Biron!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the lieutenant, who stood in fear of his men, looked at him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not so fast!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
one of the others, taking the lead, cried, &ldquo;No!&nbsp; We may have
no need of M. de Biron.&nbsp; Your name, monsieur, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick movement the stranger gripped the officer&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he who clasped
his wrist <i>thus</i> on the night of Pentecost is here, and would speak
with him!&nbsp; And say, mark you, that I will come to him, not he to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sign and the tone imposed upon the boldest.&nbsp; Two-thirds
of the watch were Huguenots, who burned to avenge the blood of their
fellows; and these, overriding their officer, had agreed to deal with
the intruder, if a Papegot, without recourse to the Grand Master, whose
moderation they dreaded.&nbsp; A knife-thrust in the ribs, and another
body in the ditch&mdash;why not, when such things were done outside?&nbsp;
But even these doubted now; and M. Peridol, the lieutenant, reading
in the eyes of his men the suspicions which he had himself conceived,
was only anxious to obey, if they would let him.&nbsp; So gravely was
he impressed, indeed, by the bearing of the unknown that he turned when
he had withdrawn, and came back to assure himself that the men meditated
no harm in his absence; nor until he had exchanged a whisper with one
of them would he leave them and go.</p>
<p>While he was gone on his errand the envoy leaned against the wall
of the gateway, and, with his chin sunk on his breast and his mind fallen
into reverie, seemed unconscious of the dark glances of which he was
the target.&nbsp; He remained in this position until the officer came
back, followed by a man with a lanthorn.&nbsp; Their coming roused the
unknown, who, invited to follow Peridol, traversed two courts without
remark, and in the same silence entered a building in the extreme eastern
corner of the enceinte abutting on the ruined Tour de Billy.&nbsp; Here,
in an upper floor, the Governor of the Arsenal had established his temporary
lodging.</p>
<p>The chamber into which the stranger was introduced betrayed the haste
in which it had been prepared for its occupant.&nbsp; Two silver lamps
which hung from the beams of the unceiled roof shed light on a medley
of arms and inlaid armour, of parchments, books and steel caskets, which
encumbered not the tables only, but the stools and chests that, after
the fashion of that day, stood formally along the arras.&nbsp; In the
midst of the disorder, on the bare floor, walked the man who, more than
any other, had been instrumental in drawing the Huguenots to Paris&mdash;and
to their doom.&nbsp; It was no marvel that the events of the day, the
surprise and horror, still rode his mind; nor wonderful that even he,
who passed for a model of stiffness and reticence, betrayed for once
the indignation which filled his breast.&nbsp; Until the officer had
withdrawn and closed the door he did, indeed, keep silence; standing
beside the table and eyeing his visitor with a lofty porte and a stern
glance.&nbsp; But the moment he was assured that they were alone he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness may unmask now,&rdquo; he said, making no effort
to hide his contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yet were you well advised to take
the precaution, since you had hardly come at me in safety without it.&nbsp;
Had those who keep the gate seen you, I would not have answered for
your Highness&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The more shame,&rdquo; he continued
vehemently, &ldquo;on the deeds of this day which have compelled the
brother of a king of France to hide his face in his own capital and
in his own fortress.&nbsp; For I dare to say, Monsieur, what no other
will say, now the Admiral is dead.&nbsp; You have brought back the days
of the Armagnacs.&nbsp; You have brought bloody days and an evil name
on France, and I pray God that you may not pay in your turn what you
have exacted.&nbsp; But if you continue to be advised by M. de Guise,
this I will say, Monsieur&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice fell low and stern.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Burgundy slew Orleans, indeed; but he came in his turn to the
Bridge of Montereau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take me for Monsieur?&rdquo; the unknown asked.&nbsp;
And it was plain that he smiled under his mask.</p>
<p>Biron&rsquo;s face altered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take you,&rdquo; he answered
sharply, &ldquo;for him whose sign you sent me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wisest are sometimes astray,&rdquo; the other answered
with a low laugh.&nbsp; And he took off his mask.</p>
<p>The Grand Master started back, his eyes sparkling with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Tavannes?&rdquo; he cried, and for a moment he was silent
in sheer astonishment.&nbsp; Then, striking his hand on the table, &ldquo;What
means this trickery?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of the simplest,&rdquo; Tavannes answered coolly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And yet, as you just now said, I had hardly come at you without
it.&nbsp; And I had to come at you.&nbsp; No, M. de Biron,&rdquo; he
added quickly, as Biron in a rage laid his hand on a bell which stood
beside him on the table, &ldquo;you cannot that way undo what is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can at least deliver you,&rdquo; the Grand Master answered,
in heat, &ldquo;to those who will deal with you as you have dealt with
us and ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will avail you nothing,&rdquo; Count Hannibal replied soberly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For see here, Grand Master, I come from the King.&nbsp; If you
are at war with him, and hold his fortress in his teeth, I am his ambassador
and sacrosanct.&nbsp; If you are at peace with him and hold it at his
will, I am his servant, and safe also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At peace and safe?&rdquo; Biron cried, his voice trembling
with indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;And are those safe or at peace who came
here trusting to <i>his</i> word, who lay in his palace and slept in
his beds?&nbsp; Where are they, and how have they fared, that you dare
appeal to the law of nations, or he to the loyalty of Biron?&nbsp; And
for you to beard me, whose brother to-day hounded the dogs of this vile
city on the noblest in France, who have leagued yourself with a crew
of foreigners to do a deed which will make our country stink in the
nostrils of the world when we are dust!&nbsp; You, to come here and
talk of peace and safety!&nbsp; M. de Tavannes&rdquo;&mdash;and he struck
his hand on the table&mdash;&ldquo;you are a bold man.&nbsp; I know
why the King had a will to send you, but I know not why you had the
will to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will tell you later,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered
coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the King, first.&nbsp; My message is brief,
M. de Biron.&nbsp; Have you a mind to hold the scales in France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between?&rdquo; Biron asked contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the Lorrainers and the Huguenots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grand Master scowled fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have played the
go-between once too often,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no question of going between, it is a question of holding
between,&rdquo; Tavannes answered coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a question&mdash;but,
in a word, have you a mind, M. de Biron, to be Governor of Rochelle?&nbsp;
The King, having dealt the blow that has been struck to-day, looks to
follow up severity, as a wise ruler should, with indulgence.&nbsp; And
to quiet the minds of the Rochellois he would set over them a ruler
at once acceptable to them&mdash;or war must come of it&mdash;and faithful
to his Majesty.&nbsp; Such a man, M. de Biron, will in such a post be
Master of the Kingdom; for he will hold the doors of Janus, and as he
bridles his sea-dogs, or unchains them, there will be peace or war in
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all that from the King&rsquo;s mouth?&rdquo; Biron asked
with sarcasm.&nbsp; But his passion had died down.&nbsp; He was grown
thoughtful, suspicious; he eyed the other intently as if he would read
his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The offer is his, and the reflections are mine,&rdquo; Tavannes
answered dryly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me add one more.&nbsp; The Admiral
is dead.&nbsp; The King of Navarre and the Prince of Cond&eacute; are
prisoners.&nbsp; Who is now to balance the Italians and the Guises?&nbsp;
The Grand Master&mdash;if he be wise and content to give the law to
France from the citadel of Rochelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biron stared at the speaker in astonishment at his frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a bold man,&rdquo; he cried at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
<i>timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>,&rdquo; he continued bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You offer, sir, too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The offer is the King&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the conditions?&nbsp; The price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you remain quiet, M. de Biron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Arsenal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Arsenal.&nbsp; And do not too openly counteract the
King&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grand Master looked puzzled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give up no one,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one!&nbsp; Let that be understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King requires no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;Does M. de Guise know of the offer?&rdquo;
Biron inquired; and his eye grew bright.&nbsp; He hated the Guises and
was hated by them.&nbsp; It was <i>there</i> he was a Huguenot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone far to-day,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered dryly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if no worse come of it should be content.&nbsp; Madame Catherine
knows of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grand Master was aware that Marshal Tavannes depended on the
Queen-mother; and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, &rsquo;tis like her policy,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like her!&rdquo;&nbsp; And pointing his guest to a
cushioned chest which stood against the wall, he sat down in a chair
beside the table and thought awhile, his brow wrinkled, his eyes dreaming.&nbsp;
By-and-by he laughed sourly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have lighted the fire,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and would fain I put it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have you hinder it spreading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done the deed and are loth to pay the blood-money.&nbsp;
That is it, is it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We prefer to pay it to M. de Biron,&rdquo; Count Hannibal
answered civilly.</p>
<p>Again the Grand Master was silent awhile.&nbsp; At length he looked
up and fixed Tavannes with eyes keen as steel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is behind?&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say, man,
what is it?&nbsp; What is behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there be aught behind, I do not know it,&rdquo; Tavannes
answered steadfastly.</p>
<p>M. de Biron relaxed the fixity of his gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you
said that you had an object?&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had&mdash;in being the bearer of the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My object?&nbsp; To learn two things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first, if it please you?&rdquo;&nbsp; The Grand Master&rsquo;s
chin stuck out a little, as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you in the Arsenal a M. de Tignonville, a gentleman of
Poitou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; Biron answered curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
second?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you here a Huguenot minister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not.&nbsp; And if I had I should not give him up,&rdquo;
he added firmly.</p>
<p>Tavannes shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a use for one,&rdquo;
he said carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it need not harm him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what, then, do you need him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you are a Catholic,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is a Huguenot,&rdquo; Tavannes answered.</p>
<p>The Grand Master did not attempt to hide his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she sticks on that?&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sticks on that.&nbsp; To-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day?&nbsp; <i>Nom de Dieu</i>!&nbsp; To-day!&nbsp; Well,&rdquo;
brushing the matter aside after a pause of bewilderment, &ldquo;any
way, I cannot help her.&nbsp; I have no minister here.&nbsp; If there
be aught else I can do for her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I thank you,&rdquo; Tavannes answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
it only remains for me to take your answer to the King?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he rose politely, and taking his mask from the table prepared to
assume it.</p>
<p>M. de Biron gazed at him a moment without speaking, as if he pondered
on the answer he should give.&nbsp; At length he nodded, and rang the
bell which stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mask!&rdquo; he muttered in a low voice as footsteps sounded
without.&nbsp; And, obedient to the hint, Tavannes disguised himself.&nbsp;
A second later the officer who had introduced him opened the door and
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peridol,&rdquo; M. de Biron said&mdash;he had risen to his
feet&mdash;&ldquo;I have received a message which needs confirmation;
and to obtain this I must leave the Arsenal.&nbsp; I am going to the
house&mdash;you will remember this&mdash;of Marshal Tavannes, who will
be responsible for my person; in the mean time this gentleman will remain
under strict guard in the south chamber upstairs.&nbsp; You will treat
him as a hostage, with all respect, and will allow him to preserve his
<i>incognito</i>.&nbsp; But if I do not return by noon to-morrow, you
will deliver him to the men below, who will know how to deal with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal made no attempt to interrupt him, nor did he betray
the discomfiture which he undoubtedly felt.&nbsp; But as the Grand Master
paused&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Biron,&rdquo; he said, in a voice harsh and low, &ldquo;you
will answer to me for this!&rdquo;&nbsp; And his eyes glittered through
the slits in the mask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, but not to-day or to-morrow!&rdquo; Biron replied,
shrugging his shoulders contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peridol! see the
gentleman bestowed as I have ordered, and then return to me.&nbsp; Monsieur,&rdquo;
with a bow, half courteous, half ironical, &ldquo;let me commend to
you the advantages of silence and your mask.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he waved
his hand in the direction of the door.</p>
<p>A moment Count Hannibal hesitated.&nbsp; He was in the heart of a
hostile fortress where the resistance of a single man armed to the teeth
must have been futile; and he was unarmed, save for a poniard.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, for a moment the impulse to spring on Biron, and with
the dagger at his throat to make his life the price of a safe passage,
was strong.&nbsp; Then&mdash;for with the warp of a harsh and passionate
character were interwrought an odd shrewdness and some things little
suspected&mdash;he resigned himself.&nbsp; Bowing gravely, he turned
with dignity, and in silence followed the officer from the room.</p>
<p>Peridol had two men in waiting at the door.&nbsp; From one of these
the lieutenant took a lanthorn, and, with an air at once sullen and
deferential, led the way up the stone staircase to the floor over that
in which M. de Biron had his lodging.&nbsp; Tavannes followed; the two
guards came last, carrying a second lanthorn.&nbsp; At the head of the
staircase, whence a bare passage ran, north and south, the procession
turned right-handed, and, passing two doors, halted before the third
and last, which faced them at the end of the passage.&nbsp; The lieutenant
unlocked it with a key which he took from a hook beside the doorpost.&nbsp;
Then, holding up his light, he invited his charge to enter.</p>
<p>The room was not small, but it was low in the roof, and prison-like,
it had bare walls and smoke-marks on the ceiling.&nbsp; The window,
set in a deep recess, the floor of which rose a foot above that of the
room, was unglazed; and through the gloomy orifice the night wind blew
in, laden even on that August evening with the dank mist of the river
flats.&nbsp; A table, two stools, and a truckle bed without straw or
covering made up the furniture; but Peridol, after glancing round, ordered
one of the men to fetch a truss of straw and the other to bring up a
pitcher of wine.&nbsp; While they were gone Tavannes and he stood silently
waiting, until, observing that the captive&rsquo;s eyes sought the window,
the lieutenant laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bars?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, Monsieur, and no
need of them.&nbsp; You will not go by that road, bars or no bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is below?&rdquo; Count Hannibal asked carelessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur,&rdquo; with a grin; &ldquo;but not water.&nbsp;
Mud, and six feet of it, soft as Christmas porridge, but not so sweet.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known two puppies thrown in under this window that did not
weigh more than a fat pullet apiece.&nbsp; One was gone before you could
count fifty, and the other did not live thrice as long&mdash;nor would
have lasted that time, but that it fell on the first and clung to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes dismissed the matter with a shrug, and, drawing his cloak
about him, set a stool against the wall and sat down.&nbsp; The men
who brought in the wine and the bundle of straw were inquisitive, and
would have loitered, scanning him stealthily; but Peridol hurried them
away.&nbsp; The lieutenant himself stayed only to cast a glance round
the room, and to mutter that he would return when his lord returned;
then, with a &ldquo;Good night&rdquo; which said more for his manners
than his good will, he followed them out.&nbsp; A moment later the grating
of the key in the lock and the sound of the bolts as they sped home
told Tavannes that he was a prisoner.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.&nbsp; TOO SHORT A SPOON.</h2>
<p>Count Hannibal remained seated, his chin sunk on his breast, until
his ear assured him that the three men had descended the stairs to the
floor below.&nbsp; Then he rose, and, taking the lanthorn from the table,
on which Peridol had placed it, he went softly to the door, which, like
the window, stood in a recess&mdash;in this case the prolongation of
the passage.&nbsp; A brief scrutiny satisfied him that escape that way
was impossible, and he turned, after a cursory glance at the floor and
ceiling, to the dark, windy aperture which yawned at the end of the
apartment.&nbsp; Placing the lanthorn on the table, and covering it
with his cloak, he mounted the window recess, and, stepping to the unguarded
edge, looked out.</p>
<p>He knew, rather than saw, that Peridol had told the truth.&nbsp;
The smell of the aguish flats which fringed that part of Paris rose
strong in his nostrils.&nbsp; He guessed that the sluggish arm of the
Seine which divided the Arsenal from the &Icirc;le des Louviers crawled
below; but the night was dark, and it was impossible to discern land
from water.&nbsp; He fancied that he could trace the outline of the
island&mdash;an uninhabited place, given up to wood piles; but the lights
of the college quarter beyond it, which rose feebly twinkling to the
crown of St. Genevieve, confused his sight and rendered the nearer gloom
more opaque.&nbsp; From that direction and from the Cit&eacute; to his
right came sounds which told of a city still heaving in its blood-stained
sleep, and even in its dreams planning further excesses.&nbsp; Now a
distant shot, and now a faint murmur on one of the bridges, or a far-off
cry, raucous, sudden, curdled the blood.&nbsp; But even of what was
passing under cover of the darkness, he could learn little; and after
standing awhile with a hand on either side of the window he found the
night air chill.&nbsp; He stepped back, and, descending to the floor,
uncovered the lanthorn and set it on the table.&nbsp; His thoughts travelled
back to the preparations he had made the night before with a view to
securing Mademoiselle&rsquo;s person, and he considered, with a grim
smile, how little he had foreseen that within twenty-four hours he would
himself be a prisoner.&nbsp; Presently, finding his mask oppressive,
he removed it, and, laying it on the table before him, sat scowling
at the light.</p>
<p>Biron had jockeyed him cleverly.&nbsp; Well, the worse for Armand
de Gontaut de Biron if after this adventure the luck went against him!&nbsp;
But in the mean time?&nbsp; In the mean time his fate was sealed if
harm befell Biron.&nbsp; And what the King&rsquo;s real mind in Biron&rsquo;s
case was, and what the Queen-Mother&rsquo;s, he could not say; just
as it was impossible to predict how far, when they had the Grand Master
at their mercy, they would resist the temptation to add him to the victims.&nbsp;
If Biron placed himself at once in Marshal Tavannes&rsquo; hands, all
might be well.&nbsp; But if he ventured within the long arm of the Guises,
or went directly to the Louvre, the fact that with the Grand Master&rsquo;s
fate Count Hannibal&rsquo;s was bound up, would not weigh a straw.&nbsp;
In such crises the great sacrificed the less great, the less great the
small, without a scruple.&nbsp; And the Guises did not love Count Hannibal;
he was not loved by many.&nbsp; Even the strength of his brother the
Marshal stood rather in the favour of the King&rsquo;s heir, for whom
he had won the battle of Jarnac, than intrinsically; and, durable in
ordinary times, might snap in the clash of forces and interests which
the desperate madness of this day had let loose on Paris.</p>
<p>It was not the peril in which he stood, however&mdash;though, with
the cold clear eye of the man who had often faced peril, he appreciated
it to a nicety&mdash;that Count Hannibal found least bearable, but his
enforced inactivity.&nbsp; He had thought to ride the whirlwind and
direct the storm, and out of the danger of others to compact his own
success.&nbsp; Instead he lay here, not only powerless to guide his
destiny, which hung on the discretion of another, but unable to stretch
forth a finger to further his plans.</p>
<p>As he sat looking darkly at the lanthorn, his mind followed Biron
and his riders through the midnight streets along St. Antoine and La
Verrerie, through the gloomy narrows of the Rue la Ferronerie, and so
past the house in the Rue St. Honor&eacute; where Mademoiselle sat awaiting
the morrow&mdash;sat awaiting Tignonville, the minister, the marriage!&nbsp;
Doubtless there were still bands of plunderers roaming to and fro; at
the barriers troops of archers stopping the suspected; at the windows
pale faces gazing down; at the gates of the Temple, and of the walled
enclosures which largely made up the city, strong guards set to prevent
invasion.&nbsp; Biron would go with sufficient to secure himself; and
unless he encountered the bodyguard of Guise his passage would quiet
the town.&nbsp; But was it so certain that <i>she</i> was safe?&nbsp;
He knew his men, and while he had been free he had not hesitated to
leave her in their care.&nbsp; But now that he could not go, now that
he could not raise a hand to help, the confidence which had not failed
him in straits more dangerous grew weak.&nbsp; He pictured the things
which might happen, at which, in his normal frame of mind, he would
have laughed.&nbsp; Now they troubled him so that he started at a shadow,
so that he quailed at a thought.&nbsp; He, who last night, when free
to act, had timed his coming and her rescue to a minute!&nbsp; Who had
rejoiced in the peril, since with the glamour of such things foolish
women were taken!&nbsp; Who had not flinched when the crowd roared most
fiercely for her blood!</p>
<p>Why had he suffered himself to be trapped?&nbsp; Why indeed?&nbsp;
And thrice in passion he paced the room.&nbsp; Long ago the famous Nostradamus
had told him that he would live to be a king, but of the smallest kingdom
in the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man is a king in his coffin,&rdquo;
he had answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The grave is cold and your kingdom shall
be warm,&rdquo; the wizard had rejoined.&nbsp; On which the courtiers
had laughed, promising him a Moorish island and a black queen.&nbsp;
And he had gibed with the rest, but secretly had taken note of the sovereign
counties of France, their rulers and their heirs.&nbsp; Now he held
the thought in horror, foreseeing no county, but the cage under the
stifling tiles at Loches, in which Cardinal Balue and many another had
worn out their hearts.</p>
<p>He came to that thought not by way of his own peril, but of Mademoiselle&rsquo;s;
which affected him in so novel a fashion that he wondered at his folly.&nbsp;
At last, tired of watching the shadows which the draught set dancing
on the wall, he drew his cloak about him and lay down on the straw.&nbsp;
He had kept vigil the previous night, and in a few minutes, with a campaigner&rsquo;s
ease, he was asleep.</p>
<p>Midnight had struck.&nbsp; About two the light in the lanthorn burned
low in the socket, and with a soft sputtering went out.&nbsp; For an
hour after that the room lay still, silent, dark; then slowly the grey
dawn, the greyer for the river mist which wrapped the neighbourhood
in a clammy shroud, began to creep into the room and discover the vague
shapes of things.&nbsp; Again an hour passed, and the sun was rising
above Montreuil, and here and there the river began to shimmer through
the fog.&nbsp; But in the room it was barely daylight when the sleeper
awoke, and sat up, his face expectant.&nbsp; Something had roused him.&nbsp;
He listened.</p>
<p>His ear, and the habit of vigilance which a life of danger instils,
had not deceived him.&nbsp; There were men moving in the passage; men
who shuffled their feet impatiently.&nbsp; Had Biron returned?&nbsp;
Or had aught happened to him, and were these men come to avenge him?&nbsp;
Count Hannibal rose and stole across the boards to the door, and, setting
his ear to it, listened.</p>
<p>He listened while a man might count a hundred and fifty, counting
slowly.&nbsp; Then, for the third part of a second, he turned his head,
and his eyes travelled the room.&nbsp; He stooped again and listened
more closely, scarcely breathing.&nbsp; There were voices as well as
feet to be heard now; one voice&mdash;he thought it was Peridol&rsquo;s&mdash;which
held on long, now low, now rising into violence.&nbsp; Others were audible
at intervals, but only in a growl or a bitter exclamation, that told
of minds made up and hands which would not be restrained.&nbsp; He caught
his own name, <i>Tavannes</i>&mdash;the mask was useless, then!&nbsp;
And once a noisy movement which came to nothing, foiled, he fancied,
by Peridol.</p>
<p>He knew enough.&nbsp; He rose to his full height, and his eyes seemed
a little closer together; an ugly smile curved his lips.&nbsp; His gaze
travelled over the objects in the room, the bare stools and table, the
lanthorn, the wine-pitcher; beyond these, in a corner, the cloak and
straw on the low bed.&nbsp; The light, cold and grey, fell cheerlessly
on the dull chamber, and showed it in harmony with the ominous whisper
which grew in the gallery; with the stern-faced listener who stood,
his one hand on the door.&nbsp; He looked, but he found nothing to his
purpose, nothing to serve his end, whatever his end was; and with a
quick light step he left the door, mounted the window recess, and, poised
on the very edge, looked down.</p>
<p>If he thought to escape that way his hope was desperate.&nbsp; The
depth to the water-level was not, he judged, twelve feet.&nbsp; But
Peridol had told the truth.&nbsp; Below lay not water, but a smooth
surface of viscid slime, here luminous with the florescence of rottenness,
there furrowed by a tiny runnel of moisture which sluggishly crept across
it to the slow stream beyond.&nbsp; This quicksand, vile and treacherous,
lapped the wall below the window, and more than accounted for the absence
of bars or fastenings.&nbsp; But, leaning far out, he saw that it ended
at the angle of the building, at a point twenty feet or so to the right
of his position.</p>
<p>He sprang to the floor again, and listened an instant; then, with
guarded movements&mdash;for there was fear in the air, fear in the silent
room, and at any moment the rush might be made, the door burst in&mdash;he
set the lanthorn and wine-pitcher on the floor, and took up the table
in his arms.&nbsp; He began to carry it to the window, but, halfway
thither, his eye told him that it would not pass through the opening,
and he set it down again and glided to the bed.&nbsp; Again he was thwarted;
the bed was screwed to the floor.&nbsp; Another might have despaired
at that, but he rose with no sign of dismay, and listening, always listening,
he spread his cloak on the floor, and deftly, with as little noise and
rustling as might be, be piled the straw in it, compressed the bundle,
and, cutting the bed-cords with his dagger, bound all together with
them.&nbsp; In three steps he was in the embrasure of the window, and,
even as the men in the passage thrust the lieutenant aside and with
a sudden uproar came down to the door, he flung the bundle lightly and
carefully to the right&mdash;so lightly and carefully, and with so nice
and deliberate a calculation, that it seemed odd it fell beyond the
reach of an ordinary leap.</p>
<p>An instant and he was on the floor again.&nbsp; The men had to unlock,
to draw back the bolts, to draw back the door which opened outwards;
their numbers, as well as their savage haste, impeded them.&nbsp; When
they burst in at last, with a roar of &ldquo;To the river!&nbsp; To
the river!&rdquo;&mdash;burst in a rush of struggling shoulders and
lowered pikes, they found him standing, a solitary figure, on the further
side of the table, his arms folded.&nbsp; And the sight of the passive
figure for a moment stayed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say your prayers, child of Satan!&rdquo; cried the leader,
waving his weapon.&nbsp; &ldquo;We give you one minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, one minute!&rdquo; his followers chimed in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be
ready!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would murder me?&rdquo; he said with dignity.&nbsp; And
when they shouted assent, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is between you and M. de Biron, whose guest I am.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;with
a glance which passed round the ring of glaring eyes and working features&mdash;&ldquo;I
would leave a last word for some one.&nbsp; Is there any one here who
values a safe-conduct from the King?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis for two men coming
and going for a fortnight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he held up a slip of paper.</p>
<p>The leader cried, &ldquo;To hell with his safe-conduct!&nbsp; Say
your prayers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all were not of his mind.&nbsp; On one or two of the savage faces&mdash;the
faces, for the most part, of honest men maddened by their wrongs&mdash;flashed
an avaricious gleam.&nbsp; A safe-conduct?&nbsp; To avenge, to slay,
to kill&mdash;and to go safe!&nbsp; For some minds such a thing has
an invincible fascination.&nbsp; A man thrust himself forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I&rsquo;ll have it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
it here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is yours,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered, &ldquo;if you
will carry ten words to Marshal Tavannes&mdash;when I am gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s neighbour laid a restraining hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Marshal Tavannes will pay you finely,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But Maudron, the man who had offered, shook off the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I take the message!&rdquo; he muttered in a grim aside.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think me mad?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then aloud he cried, &ldquo;Ay,
I&rsquo;ll take your message!&nbsp; Give me the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swear you will take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man had no intention of taking it, but he perjured himself and
went forward.&nbsp; The others would have pressed round too, half in
envy, half in scorn; but Tavannes by a gesture stayed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I ask a minute only,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
minute for a dying man is not much.&nbsp; Your friends had as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the fellows, acknowledging the claim and assured that their victim
could not escape, let Maudron go round the table to him.</p>
<p>The man was in haste and ill at ease, conscious of his evil intentions
and the fraud he was practising; and at once greedy to have, yet ashamed
of the bargain he was making.&nbsp; His attention was divided between
the slip of paper, on which his eyes fixed themselves, and the attitude
of his comrades; he paid little heed to Count Hannibal, whom he knew
to be unarmed.&nbsp; Only when Tavannes seemed to ponder on his message,
and to be fain to delay, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he muttered with brutal
frankness; &ldquo;your time is up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes started, the paper slipped from his fingers.&nbsp; Maudron
saw a chance of getting it without committing himself, and quick as
the thought leapt up in his mind he stooped, and grasped the paper,
and would have leapt back with it!&nbsp; But quick as he, and quicker,
Tavannes too stooped, gripped him by the waist, and with a prodigious
effort, and a yell in which all the man&rsquo;s stormy nature, restrained
to a part during the last few minutes, broke forth, he flung the ill-fated
wretch head first through the window.</p>
<p>The movement carried Tavannes himself&mdash;even while his victim&rsquo;s
scream rang through the chamber&mdash;into the embrasure.&nbsp; An instant
he hung on the verge; then, as the men, a moment thunderstruck, sprang
forward to avenge their comrade, he leapt out, jumping for the struggling
body that had struck the mud, and now lay in it face downwards.</p>
<p>He alighted on it, and drove it deep into the quaking slime; but
he himself bounded off right-handed.&nbsp; The peril was appalling,
the possibility untried, the chance one which only a doomed man would
have taken.&nbsp; But he reached the straw-bale, and it gave him a momentary,
a precarious footing.&nbsp; He could not regain his balance, he could
not even for an instant stand upright on it.&nbsp; But from its support
he leapt on convulsively, and, as a pike, flung from above, wounded
him in the shoulder, he fell his length in the slough&mdash;but forward,
with his outstretched hands resting on soil of a harder nature.&nbsp;
They sank, it is true, to the elbow, but he dragged his body forward
on them, and forward, and freeing one by a last effort of strength&mdash;he
could not free both, and, as it was, half his face was submerged&mdash;he
reached out another yard, and gripped a balk of wood, which projected
from the corner of the building for the purpose of fending off the stream
in flood-time.</p>
<p>The men at the window shrieked with rage as he slowly drew himself
from the slough, and stood from head to foot a pillar of mud.&nbsp;
Shout as they might, they had no firearms, and, crowded together in
the narrow embrasure, they could take no aim with their pikes.&nbsp;
They could only look on in furious impotence, flinging curses at him
until he passed from their view, behind the angle of the building.</p>
<p>Here for a score of yards a strip of hard foreshore ran between mud
and wall.&nbsp; He struggled along it until he reached the end of the
wall; then with a shuddering glance at the black heaving pit from which
he had escaped, and which yet gurgled above the body of the hapless
Maudron&mdash;a tribute to horror which even his fierce nature could
not withhold&mdash;he turned and painfully climbed the river-bank.&nbsp;
The pike-wound in his shoulder was slight, but the effort had been supreme;
the sweat poured from his brow, his visage was grey and drawn.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, when he had put fifty paces between himself and the buildings
of the Arsenal he paused, and turned.&nbsp; He saw that the men had
run to other windows which looked that way; and his face lightened and
his form dilated with triumph.</p>
<p>He shook his fist at them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, fools!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;you kill not Tavannes so!&nbsp; Till our next meeting at Montfaucon,
fare you well!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; THE BROTHER OF ST. MAGLOIRE.</h2>
<p>As the exertion of power is for the most part pleasing, so the exercise
of that which a woman possesses over a man is especially pleasant.&nbsp;
When in addition a risk of no ordinary kind has been run, and the happy
issue has been barely expected&mdash;above all when the momentary gain
seems an augury of final victory&mdash;it is impossible that a feeling
akin to exultation should not arise in the mind, however black the horizon,
and however distant the fair haven.</p>
<p>The situation in which Count Hannibal left Mademoiselle de Vrillac
will be remembered.&nbsp; She had prevailed over him; but in return
he had bowed her to the earth, partly by subtle threats, and partly
by sheer savagery.&nbsp; He had left her weeping, with the words &ldquo;Madame
de Tavannes&rdquo; ringing doom in her ears, and the dark phantom of
his will pointing onward to an inevitable future.&nbsp; Had she abandoned
hope, it would have been natural.</p>
<p>But the girl was of a spirit not long nor easily cowed; and Tavannes
had not left her half an hour before the reflection, that so far the
honours of the day were hers, rose up to console her.&nbsp; In spite
of his power and her impotence, she had imposed her will upon his; she
had established an influence over him, she had discovered a scruple
which stayed him, and a limit beyond which he would not pass.&nbsp;
In the result she might escape; for the conditions which he had accepted
with an ill grace might prove beyond his fulfilling.&nbsp; She might
escape!&nbsp; True, many in her place would have feared a worse fate
and harsher handling.&nbsp; But there lay half the merit of her victory.&nbsp;
It had left her not only in a better position, but with a new confidence
in her power over her adversary.&nbsp; He would insist on the bargain
struck between them; within its four corners she could look for no indulgence.&nbsp;
But if the conditions proved to be beyond his power, she believed that
he would spare her: with an ill grace, indeed, with such ferocity and
coarse reviling as her woman&rsquo;s pride might scarcely support.&nbsp;
But he would spare her.</p>
<p>And if the worst befell her?&nbsp; She would still have the consolation
of knowing that from the cataclysm which had overwhelmed her friends
she had ransomed those most dear to her.&nbsp; Owing to the position
of her chamber, she saw nothing of the excesses to which Paris gave
itself up during the remainder of that day, and to which it returned
with unabated zest on the following morning.&nbsp; But the Carlats and
her women learned from the guards below what was passing; and quaking
and cowering in their corners fixed frightened eyes on her, who was
their stay and hope.&nbsp; How could she prove false to them?&nbsp;
How doom them to perish, had there been no question of her lover?</p>
<p>Of him she sat thinking by the hour together.&nbsp; She recalled
with solemn tenderness the moment in which he had devoted himself to
the death which came but halfway to seize them; nor was she slow to
forgive his subsequent withdrawal, and his attempt to rescue her in
spite of herself.&nbsp; She found the impulse to die glorious; the withdrawal&mdash;for
the actor was her lover&mdash;a thing done for her, which he would not
have done for himself, and which she quickly forgave him.&nbsp; The
revulsion of feeling which had conquered her at the time, and led her
to tear herself from him, no longer moved her much while all in his
action that might have seemed in other eyes less than heroic, all in
his conduct&mdash;in a crisis demanding the highest&mdash;that smacked
of common or mean, vanished, for she still clung to him.&nbsp; Clung
to him, not so much with the passion of the mature woman, as with the
maiden and sentimental affection of one who has now no hope of possessing,
and for whom love no longer spells life, but sacrifice.</p>
<p>She had leisure for these musings, for she was left to herself all
that day, and until late on the following day.&nbsp; Her own servants
waited on her, and it was known that below stairs Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
riders kept sullen ward behind barred doors and shuttered windows, refusing
admission to all who came.&nbsp; Now and again echoes of the riot which
filled the streets with bloodshed reached her ears: or word of the more
striking occurrences was brought to her by Madame Carlat.&nbsp; And
early on this second day, Monday, it was whispered that M. de Tavannes
had not returned, and that the men below were growing uneasy.</p>
<p>At last, when the suspense below and above was growing tense, it
was broken.&nbsp; Footsteps and voices were heard ascending the stairs,
the trampling and hubbub were followed by a heavy knock; perforce the
door was opened.&nbsp; While Mademoiselle, who had risen, awaited with
a beating heart she knew not what, a cowled father, in the dress of
the monks of St. Magloire, stood on the threshold, and, crossing himself,
muttered the words of benediction.&nbsp; He entered slowly.</p>
<p>No sight could have been more dreadful to Mademoiselle; for it set
at naught the conditions which she had so hardly exacted.&nbsp; What
if Count Hannibal were behind, were even now mounting the stairs, prepared
to force her to a marriage before this shaveling?&nbsp; Or ready to
proceed, if she refused, to the last extremity?&nbsp; Sudden terror
taking her by the throat choked her; her colour fled, her hand flew
to her breast.&nbsp; Yet, before the door had closed on Bigot, she had
recovered herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This intrusion is not by M. de Tavannes&rsquo; orders!&rdquo;
she cried, stepping forward haughtily.&nbsp; &ldquo;This person has
no business here.&nbsp; How dare you admit him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norman showed his bearded visage a moment at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; he muttered sullenly.&nbsp;
And he closed the door on them.</p>
<p>She had a Huguenot&rsquo;s hatred of a cowl; and, in this crisis,
her reasons for fearing it.&nbsp; Her eyes blazed with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; she cried, pointing, with a gesture of dismissal,
to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go back to him who sent you!&nbsp; If he will
insult me, let him do it to my face!&nbsp; If he will perjure himself,
let him forswear himself in person.&nbsp; Or, if you come on your own
account,&rdquo; she continued, flinging prudence to the winds, &ldquo;as
your brethren came to Philippa de Luns, to offer me the choice you offered
her, I give you her answer!&nbsp; If I had thought of myself only, I
had not lived so long!&nbsp; And rather than bear your presence or hear
your arguments&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came to a sudden, odd, quavering pause on the word; her lips
remained parted, she swayed an instant on her feet.&nbsp; The next moment
Madame Carlat, to whom the visitor had turned his shoulder, doubted
her eyes, for Mademoiselle was in the monk&rsquo;s arms!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clotilde!&nbsp; Clotilde!&rdquo; he cried, and held her to
him.</p>
<p>For the monk was M. de Tignonville!&nbsp; Under the cowl was the
lover with whom Mademoiselle&rsquo;s thoughts had been engaged.&nbsp;
In this disguise, and armed with Tavannes&rsquo; note to Madame St.
Lo&mdash;which the guards below knew for Count Hannibal&rsquo;s hand,
though they were unable to decipher the contents&mdash;he had found
no difficulty in making his way to her.</p>
<p>He had learned before he entered that Tavannes was abroad, and was
aware, therefore, that he ran little risk.&nbsp; But his betrothed,
who knew nothing of his adventures in the interval, saw in him one who
came to her at the greatest risk, across unnumbered perils, through
streets swimming with blood.&nbsp; And though she had never embraced
him save in the crisis of the massacre, though she had never called
him by his Christian name, in the joy of this meeting she abandoned
herself to him, she clung to him weeping, she forgot for the time his
defection, and thought only of him who had returned to her so gallantly,
who brought into the room a breath of Poitou, and the sea, and the old
days, and the old life; and at the sight of whom the horrors of the
last two days fell from her&mdash;for the moment.</p>
<p>And Madame Carlat wept also, and in the room was a sound of weeping.&nbsp;
The least moved was, for a certainty, M. de Tignonville himself, who,
as we know, had gone through much that day.&nbsp; But even his heart
swelled, partly with pride, partly with thankfulness that he had returned
to one who loved him so well.&nbsp; Fate had been kinder to him than
he deserved; but he need not confess that now.&nbsp; When he had brought
off the <i>coup</i> which he had in his mind, he would hasten to forget
that he had entertained other ideas.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle had been the first to be carried away; she was also
the first to recover herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; she cried suddenly, &ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo;
and she wrested herself from his embrace with violence, and stood panting,
her face white, her eyes affrighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must not!&nbsp;
And you&mdash;I had forgotten that too!&nbsp; To be here, Monsieur,
is the worst office you can do me.&nbsp; You must go!&nbsp; Go, Monsieur,
in mercy I beg of you, while it is possible.&nbsp; Every moment you
are here, every moment you spend in this house, I shudder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not fear for me,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of bravado.&nbsp;
He did not understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear for myself!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; And then, wringing
her hands, divided between her love for him and her fear for herself,
&ldquo;Oh, forgive me!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not know
that he has promised to spare me, if he cannot produce you, and&mdash;and&mdash;a
minister?&nbsp; He has granted me that; but I thought when you entered
that he had gone back on his word, and sent a priest, and it maddened
me!&nbsp; I could not bear to think that I had gained nothing.&nbsp;
Now you understand, and you will pardon me, Monsieur?&nbsp; If he cannot
produce you I am saved.&nbsp; Go then, leave me, I beg, without a moment&rsquo;s
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed derisively as he turned back his cowl and squared his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that is over!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;over and done with,
sweet!&nbsp; M. de Tavannes is at this moment a prisoner in the Arsenal.&nbsp;
On my way hither I fell in with M. de Biron, and he told me.&nbsp; The
Grand Master, who would have had me join his company, had been all night
at Marshal Tavannes&rsquo; hotel, where he had been detained longer
than he expected.&nbsp; He stood pledged to release Count Hannibal on
his return, but at my request he consented to hold him one hour, and
to do also a little thing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glow of hope which had transfigured her face faded slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not help,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if he find you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not!&nbsp; Nor you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, Monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes,&rdquo; he explained&mdash;he could not hide
his exultation, &ldquo;a message will come from the Arsenal in the name
of Tavannes, bidding the monk he sent to you bring you to him.&nbsp;
A spoken message, corroborated by my presence, should suffice: &lsquo;<i>Bid
the monk who is now with Mademoiselle</i>,&rsquo; it will run, &lsquo;<i>bring
her to me at the Arsenal, and let four pikes guard them hither</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
When I begged M. de Biron to do this, he laughed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can
do better,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;They shall bring one of Count
Hannibal&rsquo;s gloves, which he left on my table.&nbsp; Always supposing
my rascals have done him no harm, which God forbid, for I am answerable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville, delighted with the stratagem which the meeting with
Biron had suggested, could see no flaw in it.&nbsp; She could, and though
she heard him to the end, no second glow of hope softened the lines
of her features.&nbsp; With a gesture full of dignity, which took in
not only Madame Carlat and the waiting-woman who stood at the door,
but the absent servants&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of these?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What of these?&nbsp;
You forget them, Monsieur.&nbsp; You do not think, you cannot have thought,
that I would abandon them?&nbsp; That I would leave them to such mercy
as he, defeated, might extend to them?&nbsp; No, you forgot them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not know what to answer, for the jealous eyes of the frightened
waiting-woman, fierce with the fierceness of a hunted animal, were on
him.&nbsp; The Carlat and she had heard, could hear.&nbsp; At last&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better one than none!&rdquo; he muttered, in a voice so low
that if the servants caught his meaning it was but indistinctly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have to think of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I of them,&rdquo; she answered firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor
is that all.&nbsp; Were they not here, it could not be.&nbsp; My word
is passed&mdash;though a moment ago, Monsieur, in the joy of seeing
you I forgot it.&nbsp; And how,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if I keep
not my word, can I expect him to keep his?&nbsp; Or how, if I am ready
to break the bond, on this happening which I never expected, can I hold
him to conditions which he loves as little&mdash;as little as I love
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice dropped piteously on the last words; her eyes, craving
her lover&rsquo;s pardon, sought his.&nbsp; But rage, not pity or admiration,
was the feeling roused in Tignonville&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; He stood
staring at her, struck dumb by folly so immense.&nbsp; At last&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot mean this,&rdquo; he blurted out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
cannot mean, Mademoiselle, that you intend to stand on that!&nbsp; To
keep a promise wrung from you by force, by treachery, in the midst of
such horrors as he and his have brought upon us!&nbsp; It is inconceivable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I promised,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were forced to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the promise saved our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From murderers!&nbsp; From assassins!&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot go back,&rdquo; she said
firmly; &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are willing to marry him,&rdquo; he cried in ignoble
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is it!&nbsp; Nay, you must wish to marry him!&nbsp;
For, as for his conditions, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; the young man continued,
with an insulting laugh, &ldquo;you cannot think seriously of them.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> keep conditions and you in his power!&nbsp; He, Count Hannibal!&nbsp;
But for the matter of that, and were he in the mind to keep them, what
are they?&nbsp; There are plenty of ministers.&nbsp; I left one only
this morning.&nbsp; I could lay my hand on one in five minutes.&nbsp;
He has only to find one, therefore&mdash;and to find me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur,&rdquo; she cried, trembling with wounded pride,
&ldquo;it is for that reason I implore you to go.&nbsp; The sooner you
leave me, the sooner you place yourself in a position of security, the
happier for me!&nbsp; Every moment that you spend here, you endanger
both yourself and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will not be persuaded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be persuaded,&rdquo; she answered firmly, &ldquo;and
you do but&rdquo;&mdash;alas! her pride began to break down, her voice
to quiver, she looked piteously at him&mdash;&ldquo;by staying here
make it harder for me to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Madame Carlat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as they started and turned towards her&mdash;she was at the end
of the chamber by the door, almost out of earshot&mdash;she raised a
warning hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;some
one has entered the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my messenger from Biron,&rdquo; Tignonville answered
sullenly.&nbsp; And he drew his cowl over his face, and, hiding his
hands in his sleeves, moved towards the door.&nbsp; But on the threshold
he turned and held out his arms.&nbsp; He could not go thus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&nbsp;
Clotilde!&rdquo; he cried with passion, &ldquo;for the last time, listen
to me, come with me.&nbsp; Be persuaded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; Madame Carlat interposed again, and turned a
scared face on them.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no messenger!&nbsp; It is Tavannes
himself: I know his voice.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she wrung her hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Oh, mon Dieu, mon Dieu</i>, what are we to do?&rdquo; she
continued, panic-stricken.&nbsp; And she looked all ways about the room.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; AT CLOSE QUARTERS.</h2>
<p>Fear leapt into Mademoiselle&rsquo;s eyes, but she commanded herself.&nbsp;
She signed to Madame Carlat to be silent, and they listened, gazing
at one another, hoping against hope that the woman was mistaken.&nbsp;
A long moment they waited, and some were beginning to breathe again,
when the strident tones of Count Hannibal&rsquo;s voice rolled up the
staircase, and put an end to doubt.&nbsp; Mademoiselle grasped the table
and stood supporting herself by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
are we to do?&rdquo; and she turned distractedly towards the women.&nbsp;
The courage which had supported her in her lover&rsquo;s absence had
abandoned her now.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he finds him here I am lost!&nbsp;
I am lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not know me,&rdquo; Tignonville muttered.&nbsp; But
he spoke uncertainly; and his gaze, shifting hither and thither, belied
the boldness of his words.</p>
<p>Madame Carlat&rsquo;s eyes flew round the room; on her for once the
burden seemed to rest.&nbsp; Alas! the room had no second door, and
the windows looked on a courtyard guarded by Tavannes&rsquo; people.&nbsp;
And even now Count Hannibal&rsquo;s step rang on the stair! his hand
was almost on the latch.&nbsp; The woman wrung her hands; then, a thought
striking her, she darted to a corner where Mademoiselle&rsquo;s robes
hung on pegs against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she cried, raising them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behind
these!&nbsp; He may not be seen here!&nbsp; Quick, Monsieur, quick!&nbsp;
Hide yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a forlorn hope&mdash;the suggestion of one who had not thought
out the position; and, whatever its promise, Mademoiselle&rsquo;s pride
revolted against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not there!&rdquo; while
Tignonville, who knew that the step was useless, since Count Hannibal
must have learned that a monk had entered, held his ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not deny yourself?&rdquo; he muttered hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a priest with me?&rdquo; she answered; and she shook her
head.</p>
<p>There was no time for more, and even as Mademoiselle spoke Count
Hannibal&rsquo;s knuckles tapped the door.&nbsp; She cast a last look
at her lover.&nbsp; He had turned his back on the window; the light
no longer fell on his face.&nbsp; It was possible that he might pass
unrecognized, if Tavannes&rsquo; stay was brief; at any rate, the risk
must be run.&nbsp; In a half stifled voice she bade her woman, Javette,
open the door.&nbsp; Count Hannibal bowed low as he entered; and he
deceived the others.&nbsp; But he did not deceive her.&nbsp; He had
not crossed the threshold before she repented that she had not acted
on Tignonville&rsquo;s suggestion, and denied herself.&nbsp; For what
could escape those hard keen eyes, which swept the room, saw all, and
seemed to see nothing&mdash;those eyes in which there dwelt even now
a glint of cruel humour?&nbsp; He might deceive others, but she who
panted within his grasp, as the wild bird palpitates in the hand of
the fowler, was not deceived!&nbsp; He saw, he knew! although, as he
bowed, and smiling, stood upright, he looked only at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected to be with you before this,&rdquo; he said courteously,
&ldquo;but I have been detained.&nbsp; First, Mademoiselle, by some
of your friends, who were reluctant to part with me; then by some of
your enemies, who, finding me in no handsome case, took me for a Huguenot
escaped from the river, and drove me to shifts to get clear of them.&nbsp;
However, now I am come, I have news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; she muttered with dry lips.&nbsp; It could hardly
be good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle, of M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have little doubt that I shall be able to produce him this
evening, and so to satisfy one of your scruples.&nbsp; And as I trust
that this good father,&rdquo; he went on, turning to the ecclesiastic,
and speaking with the sneer from which he seldom refrained, Catholic
as he was, when he mentioned a priest, &ldquo;has by this time succeeded
in removing the other, and persuading you to accept his ministrations&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; with a dubious smile, and a glance from one to
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I had hoped better things.&nbsp; But he
still may?&nbsp; He still may.&nbsp; I am sure he may.&nbsp; In which
case, Mademoiselle, your modesty must pardon me if I plead urgency,
and fix the hour after supper this evening for the fulfilment of your
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned white to the lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;After supper?&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle, this evening.&nbsp; Shall I say&mdash;at
eight o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In horror of the thing which menaced her, of the thing from which
only two hours separated her, she could find no words but those which
she had already used.&nbsp; The worst was upon her; worse than the worst
could not befall her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has not persuaded me!&rdquo; she cried, clenching her
hands in passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has not persuaded me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still he may, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not!&rdquo; she cried wildly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will
not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was going round with her.&nbsp; The precipice yawned at
her feet; its naked terrors turned her brain.&nbsp; She had been pushed
nearer, and nearer, and nearer; struggle as she might, she was on the
verge.&nbsp; A mist rose before her eyes, and though they thought she
listened she understood nothing of what was passing.&nbsp; When she
came to herself, after the lapse of a minute, Count Hannibal was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit him another trial,&rdquo; he was saying in a tone of
bland irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;A short time longer, Mademoiselle!&nbsp; One
more assault, father!&nbsp; The weapons of the Church could not be better
directed or to a more worthy object; and, successful, shall not fail
of due recognition and an earthly reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while she listened, half fainting, with a humming in her ears,
he was gone.&nbsp; The door closed on him, and the three&mdash;Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
woman had withdrawn when she opened to him&mdash;looked at one another.&nbsp;
The girl parted her lips to speak, but she only smiled piteously; and
it was M. de Tignonville who broke the silence, in a tone which betrayed
rather relief than any other feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, all is not lost yet,&rdquo; he said briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I can escape from the house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows you,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows you,&rdquo; Mademoiselle repeated in a tone almost
apathetic.&nbsp; &ldquo;I read it in his eyes.&nbsp; He knew you at
once: and knew, too,&rdquo; she added bitterly, &ldquo;that he had here
under his hand one of the two things he required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did he hide his knowledge?&rdquo; the young man retorted
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;To induce me to waive
the other condition in the hope of saving you.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; she
continued in a tone of bitter raillery, &ldquo;he has the cunning of
hell, of the priests!&nbsp; You are no match for him, Monsieur.&nbsp;
Nor I; nor any of us.&nbsp; And&rdquo;&mdash;with a gesture of despair&mdash;&ldquo;he
will be my master!&nbsp; He will break me to his will and to his hand!&nbsp;
I shall be his!&nbsp; His, body and soul, body and soul!&rdquo; she
continued drearily, as she sank into a chair and, rocking herself to
and fro, covered her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be his!&nbsp; His till
I die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes burned, and the pulse in his temples beat wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shall not!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I may
be no match for him in cunning, you say well.&nbsp; But I can kill him.&nbsp;
And I will!&rdquo;&nbsp; He paced up and down.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have done it when he was here,&rdquo; she answered,
half in scorn, half in earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not too late,&rdquo; he cried; and then he stopped,
silenced by the opening door.&nbsp; It was Javette who entered.&nbsp;
They looked at her, and before she spoke were on their feet.&nbsp; Her
face, white and eager, marking something besides fear, announced that
she brought news.&nbsp; She closed the door behind her, and in a moment
it was told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur can escape, if he is quick,&rdquo; she cried in a
low tone; and they saw that she trembled with excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
are at supper.&nbsp; But he must be quick!&nbsp; He must be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not the door guarded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he knows!&nbsp; Your mistress says that he knows that
I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Javette looked startled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is possible,&rdquo;
she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he has gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Carlat clapped her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard the door close,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;three minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Monsieur can reach the room in which he supped last
night, the window that was broken is only blocked&rdquo;&mdash;she swallowed
once or twice in her excitement&mdash;&ldquo;with something he can move.&nbsp;
And then Monsieur is in the street, where his cowl will protect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Count Hannibal&rsquo;s men?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are eating in the lodge by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; And they cannot see the other room from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Javette nodded.&nbsp; Her tale told, she seemed to be unable to add
a word.&nbsp; Mademoiselle, who knew her for a craven, wondered that
she had found courage either to note what she had or to bring the news.&nbsp;
But as Providence had been so good to them as to put it into this woman&rsquo;s
head to act as she had, it behoved them to use the opportunity&mdash;the
last, the very last opportunity they might have.</p>
<p>She turned to Tignonville.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, go!&rdquo; she cried
feverishly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go, I beg!&nbsp; Go now, Monsieur!&nbsp; The
greatest kindness you can do me is to place yourself as quickly as possible
beyond his reach.&rdquo;&nbsp; A faint colour, the flush of hope, had
returned to her cheeks.&nbsp; Her eyes glittered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Mademoiselle!&rdquo; he cried, obedient for once, &ldquo;I
go!&nbsp; And do you be of good courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held her hand: an instant, then, moving to the door, he opened
it and listened.&nbsp; They all pressed behind him to hear.&nbsp; A
murmur of voices, low and distant, mounted the staircase and bore out
the girl&rsquo;s tale; apart from this the house was silent.&nbsp; Tignonville
cast a last look at Mademoiselle, and, with a gesture of farewell, glided
a-tiptoe to the stairs and began to descend, his face hidden in his
cowl.&nbsp; They watched him reach the angle of the staircase, they
watched him vanish beyond it; and still they listened, looking at one
another when a board creaked or the voices below were hushed for a moment.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; THE DUEL.</h2>
<p>At the foot of the staircase Tignonville paused.&nbsp; The droning
Norman voices of the men on guard issued from an open door a few paces
before him on the left.&nbsp; He caught a jest, the coarse chuckling
laughter which attended it, and the gurgle of applause which followed;
and he knew that at any moment one of the men might step out and discover
him.&nbsp; Fortunately the door of the room with the shattered window
was almost within reach of his hand on the right side of the passage,
and he stepped softly to it.&nbsp; He stood an instant hesitating, his
hand on the latch; then, alarmed by a movement in the guard-room, as
if some were rising, he pushed the door in a panic, slid into the room,
and shut the door behind him.&nbsp; He was safe, and he had made no
noise; but at the table, at supper, with his back to him and his face
to the partly closed window, sat Count Hannibal!</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s heart stood still.&nbsp; For a long minute
he gazed at the Count&rsquo;s back, spellbound and unable to stir.&nbsp;
Then, as Tavannes ate on without looking round, he began to take courage.&nbsp;
Possibly he had entered so quietly that he had not been heard, or possibly
his entrance was taken for that of a servant.&nbsp; In either case,
there was a chance that he might retire after the same fashion; and
he had actually raised the latch, and was drawing the door to him with
infinite precaution, when Tavannes&rsquo; voice struck him, as it were,
in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not admit the draught, M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; he
said, without looking round.&nbsp; &ldquo;In your cowl you do not feel
it, but it is otherwise with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate Tignonville stood transfixed, glaring at the back
of the other&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; For an instant he could not find his
voice.&nbsp; At last&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he hissed in a transport of rage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Curse you!&nbsp; You did know, then?&nbsp; And she was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that I expected you, to be sure, Monsieur,&rdquo;
Count Hannibal answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;See, your place is laid.&nbsp;
You will not feel the air from without there.&nbsp; The very becoming
dress which you have adopted secures you from cold.&nbsp; But&mdash;do
you not find it somewhat oppressive this summer weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; the young man cried, trembling.</p>
<p>Tavannes turned and looked at him with a dark smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
curse may fall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I fancy it will not be in
consequence of your petitions, Monsieur.&nbsp; And now, were it not
better you played the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were armed,&rdquo; the other cried passionately, &ldquo;you
would not insult me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sir, sit down,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered sternly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We will talk of that presently.&nbsp; In the mean time I have
something to say to you.&nbsp; Will you not eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tignonville would not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered; and he went on
with his supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am indifferent whether you eat or not.&nbsp;
It is enough for me that you are one of the two things I lacked an hour
ago; and that I have you, M. de Tignonville.&nbsp; And through you I
look to obtain the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other?&rdquo; Tignonville cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
minister.&nbsp; There are not many left in Paris&mdash;of your faith.&nbsp;
But you met one this morning, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; I met one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, you!&nbsp; And can lay your hand on him in
five minutes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville gasped.&nbsp; His face turned a shade paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a spy,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a spy
upstairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes raised his cup to his lips, and drank.&nbsp; When he had
set it down&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; he said, and he shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know, it boots not how I know.&nbsp; It is my business to make
the most of my knowledge&mdash;and of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Tignonville laughed rudely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make the most of your
own,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you will have none of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carry your mind back two days, M. de Tignonville.&nbsp; Had I
gone to Mademoiselle de Vrillac last Saturday and said to her &lsquo;Marry
me, or promise to marry me,&rsquo; what answer would she have given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have called you an insolent!&rdquo; the young man
replied hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what you would have done!&rdquo; Tavannes said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Suffice it that she would have answered as you suggest.&nbsp;
Yet to-day she has given me her promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the young man retorted, &ldquo;in circumstances
in which no man of honour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us say in peculiar circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which still exist!&nbsp; Mark me, M. de Tignonville,&rdquo;
Count Hannibal continued, leaning forward and eyeing the young man with
meaning, &ldquo;<i>which still exist</i>!&nbsp; And may have the same
effect on another&rsquo;s will as on hers!&nbsp; Listen!&nbsp; Do you
hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; And rising from his seat with a darkening face, he
pointed to the partly shuttered window, through which the measured tramp
of a body of men came heavily to the ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you hear,
Monsieur?&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; As it was yesterday it is to-day!&nbsp;
They killed the President La Place this morning!&nbsp; And they are
searching!&nbsp; They are still searching!&nbsp; The river is not yet
full, nor the gibbet glutted!&nbsp; I have but to open that window and
denounce you, and your life would hang by no stronger thread than the
life of a mad dog which they chase through the streets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man had risen also.&nbsp; He stood confronting Tavannes,
the cowl fallen back from his face, his eyes dilated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think to frighten me!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
think that I am craven enough to sacrifice her to save myself.&nbsp;
You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were craven enough to draw back yesterday, when you stood
at this window and waited for death!&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered
brutally.&nbsp; &ldquo;You flinched then, and may flinch again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo; Tignonville retorted, trembling with passion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Try me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, as the other stared at him and
made no movement, &ldquo;But you dare not!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
dare not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; For if I die you lose her!&rdquo; Tignonville replied
in a voice of triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp; I touch you there!&rdquo;
he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;You dare not, for my safety is part of the
price, and is more to you than it is to myself!&nbsp; You may threaten,
M. de Tavannes, you may bluster, and shout and point to the window&rdquo;&mdash;and
he mocked, with a disdainful mimicry, the other&rsquo;s gesture&mdash;&ldquo;but
my safety is more to you than to me!&nbsp; And &rsquo;twill end there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In two strides Count Hannibal was at the window.&nbsp; He seized
a great piece of the boarding which closed one-half of the opening;
he wrenched it away.&nbsp; A flood of evening light burst in through
the aperture, and fell on and heightened the flushed passion of his
features, as he turned again to his opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you know it,&rdquo; he cried vehemently, &ldquo;in
God&rsquo;s name act upon it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pointed to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act upon it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, act upon it!&rdquo; Tavannes repeated, with a glance of
flame.&nbsp; &ldquo;The road is open!&nbsp; If you would save your mistress,
behold the way!&nbsp; If you would save her from the embrace she abhors,
from the eyes under which she trembles, from the hand of a master, there
lies the way!&nbsp; And it is not her glove only you will save, but
herself, her soul, her body!&nbsp; So,&rdquo; he continued, with a certain
wildness, and in a tone wherein contempt and bitterness were mingled,
&ldquo;to the lions, brave lover!&nbsp; Will you your life for her honour?&nbsp;
Will you death that she may live a maid?&nbsp; Will you your head to
save her finger?&nbsp; Then, leap down! leap down!&nbsp; The lists are
open, the sand is strewed!&nbsp; Out of your own mouth I have it that
if you perish she is saved!&nbsp; Then out, Monsieur!&nbsp; Cry &lsquo;I
am a Huguenot!&rsquo;&nbsp; And God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville was livid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather, your will!&rdquo; he
panted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your will, you devil!&nbsp; Nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go!&nbsp; Ha! ha!&nbsp; You will go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant it seemed that he would go.&nbsp; Stung by the challenge,
wrought on by the contempt in which Tavannes held him, he shot a look
of hate at the tempter; he caught his breath, and laid his hand on the
edge of the shuttering as if he would leap out.</p>
<p>But it goes hard with him who has once turned back from the foe.&nbsp;
The evening light, glancing cold on the burnished pike-points of a group
of archers who stood near, caught his eye and went chill to his heart.&nbsp;
Death, not in the arena, not in the sight of shouting thousands, but
in this darkening street, with an enemy laughing from the window, death
with no revenge to follow, with no certainty that after all she would
be safe, such a death could be compassed only by pure love&mdash;the
love of a child for a parent, of a parent for a child, of a man for
the one woman in the world!</p>
<p>He recoiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would not spare her!&rdquo; he cried,
his face damp with sweat&mdash;for he knew now that he would not go.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You want to be rid of me!&nbsp; You would fool me, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of your own mouth you are convict!&rdquo; Count Hannibal
retorted gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was you who said it!&nbsp; But still
I swear it!&nbsp; Shall I swear it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tignonville recoiled another step and was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&nbsp; O <i>preux chevalier</i>, O gallant knight!&nbsp;
I knew it!&nbsp; Do you think that I did not know with whom I had to
deal?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Count Hannibal burst into harsh laughter, turning
his back on the other, as if he no longer counted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
will neither die with her nor for her!&nbsp; You were better in her
petticoats and she in your breeches!&nbsp; Or no, you are best as you
are, good father!&nbsp; Take my advice, M. de Tignonville, have done
with arms; and with a string of beads, and soft words, and talk of Holy
Mother Church, you will fool the women as surely as the best of them!&nbsp;
They are not all like my cousin, a flouting, gibing, jeering woman&mdash;you
had poor fortune there, I fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had a sword!&rdquo; Tignonville hissed, his face livid
with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call me coward, because I will not die to
please you.&nbsp; But give me a sword, and I will show you if I am a
coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes stood still.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are there, are you?&rdquo;
he said in an altered tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a sword,&rdquo; Tignonville repeated, holding out
his open trembling hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sword!&nbsp; A sword!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis easy taunting an unarmed man, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask no more!&nbsp; No more!&nbsp; Give me a sword,&rdquo;
he urged, his voice quivering with eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is you
who are the coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal stared at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what am I to get by
fighting you?&rdquo; he reasoned slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in my
power.&nbsp; I can do with you as I please.&nbsp; I can call from this
window and denounce you, or I can summon my men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coward!&nbsp; Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay?&nbsp; Well, I will tell you what I will do,&rdquo; with
a subtle smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give you a sword, M. de Tignonville,
and I will meet you foot to foot here, in this room, on a condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo; the young man cried with
incredible eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Name your condition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if I get the better of you, you find me a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find you a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister.&nbsp; Yes, that is it.&nbsp; Or tell me where
I can find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man recoiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where to find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can lay your hand on one in five minutes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall not fight you!&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered
coolly; and he turned from him, and back again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will
pardon me if I say, M. de Tignonville, that you are in as many minds
about fighting as about dying!&nbsp; I do not think that you would have
made your fortune at Court.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a thing which I
fancy you have not considered.&nbsp; If we fight you may kill me, in
which case the condition will not help me much.&nbsp; Or I&mdash;which
is more likely&mdash;&rdquo; he added, with a harsh smile, &ldquo;may
kill you, and again I am no better placed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s pallid features betrayed the conflict in his
breast.&nbsp; To do him justice, his hand itched for the sword-hilt&mdash;he
was brave enough for that; he hated, and only so could he avenge himself.&nbsp;
But the penalty if he had the worse!&nbsp; And yet what of it?&nbsp;
He was in hell now, in a hell of humiliation, shame, defeat, tormented
by this fiend!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas only to risk a lower hell.</p>
<p>At last, &ldquo;I will do it!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
me a sword and look to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I promise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered suavely, &ldquo;but we
cannot fight so, we must have more light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And striding to the door he opened it, and calling the Norman bade
him move the table and bring candles&mdash;a dozen candles; for in the
narrow streets the light was waning, and in the half-shuttered room
it was growing dusk.&nbsp; Tignonville, listening with a throbbing brain,
wondered that the attendant expressed no surprise and said no word&mdash;until
Tavannes added to his orders one for a pair of swords.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Monsieur&rsquo;s sword is here,&rdquo; Bigot answered
in his half-intelligible patois.&nbsp; &ldquo;He left it here yester
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good fellow, Bigot,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, with
a gaiety and good-humour which astonished Tignonville.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
one of these days you shall marry Suzanne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norman smiled sourly and went in search of the weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a poniard?&rdquo; Count Hannibal continued in the
same tone of unusual good temper, which had already struck Tignonville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Excellent!&nbsp; Will you strip, then, or&mdash;as we are?&nbsp;
Very good, Monsieur; in the unlikely event of fortune declaring for
you, you will be in a better condition to take care of yourself.&nbsp;
A man running through the streets in his shirt is exposed to inconveniences!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he laughed gaily.</p>
<p>While he laughed the other listened; and his rage began to give place
to wonder.&nbsp; A man who regarded as a pastime a sword and dagger
conflict between four walls, who, having his adversary in his power,
was ready to discard the advantage, to descend into the lists, and to
risk life for a whim, a fancy&mdash;such a man was outside his experience,
though in Poitou in those days of war were men reckoned brave.&nbsp;
For what, he asked himself as he waited, had Tavannes to gain by fighting?&nbsp;
The possession of Mademoiselle?&nbsp; But Mademoiselle, if his passion
for her overwhelmed him, was in his power; and if his promise were a
barrier&mdash;which seemed inconceivable in the light of his reputation&mdash;he
had only to wait, and to-morrow, or the next day, or the next, a minister
would be found, and without risk he could gain that for which he was
now risking all.</p>
<p>Tignonville did not know that it was in the other&rsquo;s nature
to find pleasure in such utmost ventures.&nbsp; Nevertheless the recklessness
to which Tavannes&rsquo; action bore witness had its effect upon him.&nbsp;
By the time the young man&rsquo;s sword arrived something of his passion
for the conflict had evaporated; and though the touch of the hilt restored
his determination, the locked door, the confined space, and the unaccustomed
light went a certain distance towards substituting despair for courage.</p>
<p>The use of the dagger in the duels of that day, however, rendered
despair itself formidable.&nbsp; And Tignonville, when he took his place,
appeared anything but a mean antagonist.&nbsp; He had removed his robe
and cowl, and lithe and active as a cat he stood as it were on springs,
throwing his weight now on this foot and now on that, and was continually
in motion.&nbsp; The table bearing the candles had been pushed against
the window, the boarding of which had been replaced by Bigot before
he left the room.&nbsp; Tignonville had this, and consequently the lights,
on his dagger hand; and he plumed himself on the advantage, considering
his point the more difficult to follow.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal did not seem to notice this, however.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you ready?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; And then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On guard!&rdquo; he cried, and he stamped the echo to the
word.&nbsp; But, that done, instead of bearing the other down with a
headlong rush characteristic of the man&mdash;as Tignonville feared&mdash;he
held off warily, stooping low; and when his slow opening was met by
one as cautious, he began to taunt his antagonist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he cried, and feinted half-heartedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
Monsieur, are we going to fight, or play at fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight yourself, then!&rdquo; Tignonville answered, his breath
quickened by excitement and growing hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not
I hold back!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he lunged, but was put aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&Ccedil;a! &ccedil;a!&rdquo; Tavannes retorted; and he lunged
and parried in his turn, but loosely and at a distance.</p>
<p>After which the two moved nearer the door, their eyes glittering
as they watched one another, their knees bent, the sinews of their backs
straining for the leap.&nbsp; Suddenly Tavannes thrust, and leapt away,
and as his antagonist thrust in return the Count swept the blade aside
with a strong parry, and for a moment seemed to be on the point of falling
on Tignonville with the poniard.&nbsp; But Tignonville retired his right
foot nimbly, which brought them front to front again.&nbsp; And the
younger man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again, M. le Comte!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And, with the
word, he dashed in himself quick as light; for a second the blades ground
on one another, the daggers hovered, the two suffused faces glared into
one another; then the pair disengaged again.</p>
<p>The blood trickled from a scratch on Count Hannibal&rsquo;s neck;
half an inch to the right and the point had found his throat.&nbsp;
And Tignonville, elated, laughed anew, and swaying from side to side
on his hips, watched with growing confidence for a second chance.&nbsp;
Lithe as one of the leopards Charles kept at the Louvre, he stooped
lower and lower, and more and more with each moment took the attitude
of the assailant, watching for an opening; while Count Hannibal, his
face dark and his eyes vigilant, stood increasingly on the defence.&nbsp;
The light was waning a little, the wicks of the candles were burning
long; but neither noticed it or dared to remove his eyes from the other&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Their laboured breathing found an echo on the farther side of the door,
but this again neither observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Count Hannibal said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I please,&rdquo; Tignonville answered; and he feinted
but drew back.</p>
<p>The other did the same, and again they watched one another, their
eyes seeming to grow smaller and smaller.&nbsp; Gradually a smile had
birth on Tignonville&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; He thrust!&nbsp; It was parried!&nbsp;
He thrust again&mdash;parried!&nbsp; Tavannes, grown still more cautious,
gave a yard.&nbsp; Tignonville pushed on, but did not allow confidence
to master caution.&nbsp; He began, indeed, to taunt his adversary; to
flout and jeer him.&nbsp; But it was with a motive.</p>
<p>For suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he repeated the peculiar
thrust which had been successful before.&nbsp; This time, however, Tavannes
was ready.&nbsp; He put aside the blade with a quick parade, and instead
of making a riposte sprang within the other&rsquo;s guard.&nbsp; The
two came face to face and breast to shoulder, and struck furiously with
their daggers.&nbsp; Count Hannibal was outside his opponent&rsquo;s
sword and had the advantage.&nbsp; Tignonville&rsquo;s dagger fell,
but glanced off the metalwork of the other&rsquo;s hilt; Tavannes&rsquo;
fell swift and hard between the young man&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The Huguenot
flung up his hands and staggered back, falling his length on the floor.</p>
<p>In an instant Count Hannibal was on his breast, and had knocked away
his dagger.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You own yourself vanquished?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The young man, blinded by the blood which trickled down his face,
made a sign with his hands.&nbsp; Count Hannibal rose to his feet again,
and stood a moment looking at his foe without speaking.&nbsp; Presently
he seemed to be satisfied.&nbsp; He nodded, and going to the table dipped
a napkin in water.&nbsp; He brought it, and carefully supporting Tignonville&rsquo;s
head, laved his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as I thought,&rdquo; he said, when he had stanched the
blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not hurt, man.&nbsp; You are stunned.&nbsp;
It is no more than a bruise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was coming to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
he muttered, and broke off to pass his hand over his face.&nbsp; Then
he got up slowly, reeling a little, &ldquo;I thought it was the point,&rdquo;
he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was the pommel,&rdquo; Tavannes answered dryly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would not have served me to kill you.&nbsp; I could have done
that ten times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville groaned, and, sitting down at the table, held the napkin
to his aching head.&nbsp; One of the candles had been overturned in
the struggle and lay on the floor, flaring in a little pool of grease.&nbsp;
Tavannes set his heel upon it; then, striding to the farther end of
the room, he picked up Tignonville&rsquo;s dagger and placed it beside
his sword on the table.&nbsp; He looked about to see if aught else remained
to do, and, finding nothing, he returned to Tignonville&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsieur,&rdquo; he said in a voice hard and constrained,
&ldquo;I must ask you to perform your part of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan of anguish broke from the unhappy man.&nbsp; And yet he had
set his life on the cast; what more could he have done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not harm him?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall go safe,&rdquo; Count Hannibal replied gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; he fought a moment with his pride, then
blurted out the words, &ldquo;you will not tell her&mdash;that it was
through me&mdash;you found him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; Tavannes answered in the same tone.&nbsp;
He stooped and picked up the other&rsquo;s robe and cowl, which had
fallen from a chair&mdash;so that as he spoke his eyes were averted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She shall never know through me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And Tignonville, his face hidden in his hands, told him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.&nbsp; ANDROMEDA, PERSEUS BEING ABSENT.</h2>
<p>Little by little&mdash;while they fought below&mdash;the gloom had
thickened, and night had fallen in the room above.&nbsp; But Mademoiselle
would not have candles brought.&nbsp; Seated in the darkness, on the
uppermost step of the stairs, her hands clasped about her knees, she
listened and listened, as if by that action she could avert misfortune;
or as if, by going so far forward to meet it, she could turn aside the
worst.&nbsp; The women shivering in the darkness about her would fain
have struck a light and drawn her back into the room, for they felt
safer there.&nbsp; But she was not to be moved.&nbsp; The laughter and
chatter of the men in the guard-room, the coming and going of Bigot
as he passed, below but out of sight, had no terrors for her; nay, she
breathed more freely on the bare open landing of the staircase than
in the close confines of a room which her fears made hateful to her.&nbsp;
Here at least she could listen, her face unseen; and listening she bore
the suspense more easily.</p>
<p>A turn in the staircase, with the noise which proceeded from the
guard-room, rendered it difficult to hear what happened in the closed
room below.&nbsp; But she thought that if an alarm were raised there
she must hear it; and as the moments passed and nothing happened, she
began to feel confident that her lover had made good his escape by the
window.</p>
<p>Presently she got a fright.&nbsp; Three or four men came from the
guard-room and went, as it seemed to her, to the door of the room with
the shattered casement.&nbsp; She told herself that she had rejoiced
too soon, and her heart stood still.&nbsp; She waited for a rush of
feet, a cry, a struggle.&nbsp; But except an uncertain muffled sound
which lasted for some minutes, and was followed by a dull shock, she
heard nothing more.&nbsp; And presently the men went back whispering,
the noise in the guard-room which had been partially hushed broke forth
anew, and perplexed but relieved she breathed again.&nbsp; Surely he
had escaped by this time.&nbsp; Surely by this time he was far away,
in the Arsenal, or in some place of refuge!&nbsp; And she might take
courage, and feel that for this day the peril was overpast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle will have the lights now?&rdquo; one of the women
ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she answered feverishly, and she continued
to crouch where she was on the stairs, bathing herself and her burning
face in the darkness and coolness of the stairway.&nbsp; The air entered
freely through a window at her elbow, and the place was fresher, were
that all, than the room she had left.&nbsp; Javette began to whimper,
but she paid no heed to her; a man came and went along the passage below,
and she heard the outer door unbarred, and the jarring tread of three
or four men who passed through it.&nbsp; But all without disturbance;
and afterwards the house was quiet again.&nbsp; And as on this Monday
evening the prime virulence of the massacre had begun to abate&mdash;though
it held after a fashion to the end of the week&mdash;Paris without was
quiet also.&nbsp; The sounds which had chilled her heart at intervals
during two days were no longer heard.&nbsp; A feeling almost of peace,
almost of comfort&mdash;a drowsy feeling, that was three parts a reaction
from excitement&mdash;took possession of her.&nbsp; In the darkness
her head sank lower and lower on her knees.&nbsp; And half an hour passed,
while Javette whimpered, and Madame Carlat slumbered, her broad back
propped against the wall.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mademoiselle opened her eyes, and saw, three steps below
her, a strange man whose upward way she barred.&nbsp; Behind him came
Carlat, and behind him Bigot, lighting both; and in the confusion of
her thoughts as she rose to her feet the three, all staring at her in
a common amazement, seemed a company.&nbsp; The air entering through
the open window beside her blew the flame of the candle this way and
that, and added to the nightmare character of the scene; for by the
shifting light the men seemed to laugh one moment and scowl the next,
and their shadows were now high and now low on the wall.&nbsp; In truth,
they were as much amazed at coming on her in that place as she at their
appearance; but they were awake, and she newly roused from sleep; and
the advantage was with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she cried in a panic.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle will return to her room?&rdquo; one of the
men said courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; She was frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned without more and went back into the room, and the
three followed, and her woman and Madame Carlat.&nbsp; She stood resting
one hand on the table while Javette with shaking fingers lighted the
candles.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsieur,&rdquo; she said in a hard voice, &ldquo;if
you will tell me your business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know me?&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger&rsquo;s eyes
dwelt kindly and pitifully on her.</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily, crushing down the fears which knocked
at her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet I think I have seen
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me a week last Sunday,&rdquo; the stranger answered
sorrowfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is La Tribe.&nbsp; I preached that
day, Mademoiselle, before the King of Navarre.&nbsp; I believe that
you were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stared at him in silence, her lips parted.&nbsp;
Then she laughed, a laugh which set the teeth on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is clever!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has the
wit of the priests!&nbsp; Or the devil!&nbsp; But you come too late,
Monsieur!&nbsp; You come too late!&nbsp; The bird has flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you the bird has flown!&rdquo; she repeated vehemently.&nbsp;
And her laugh of joyless triumph rang through the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
is clever, but I have outwitted him!&nbsp; I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and stared about her wildly, struck by the silence; struck
too by something solemn, something pitiful in the faces that were turned
on her.&nbsp; And her lip began to quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you look at
me so?&nbsp; He has not&rdquo;&mdash;she turned from one to another&mdash;&ldquo;he
has not been taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>They expected to see her break down, perhaps to see her fall.&nbsp;
But she only groped blindly for a chair and sat.&nbsp; And for a moment
there was silence in the room.&nbsp; It was the Huguenot minister who
broke it in a tone formal and solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, all present!&rdquo; he said slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
ways of God are past finding out.&nbsp; For two days in the midst of
great perils I have been preserved by His hand and fed by His bounty,
and I am told that I shall live if, in this matter, I do the will of
those who hold me in their power.&nbsp; But be assured&mdash;and hearken
all,&rdquo; he continued, lowering his voice to a sterner note.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rather than marry this woman to this man against her will&mdash;if
indeed in His sight such marriage can be&mdash;rather than save my life
by such base compliance, I will die not once but ten times!&nbsp; See.&nbsp;
I am ready!&nbsp; I will make no defence!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he opened
his arms as if to welcome the stroke.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there be trickery
here, if there has been practising below, where they told me this and
that, it shall not avail!&nbsp; Until I hear from Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
own lips that she is willing, I will not say over her so much as Yea,
yea, or Nay, nay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is willing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe turned sharply, and beheld the speaker.&nbsp; It was Count
Hannibal, who had entered a few seconds earlier, and had taken his stand
within the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is willing!&rdquo; Tavannes repeated quietly.&nbsp; And
if, in this moment of the fruition of his schemes, he felt his triumph,
he masked it under a face of sombre purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you doubt
me, man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her own lips!&rdquo; the other replied, undaunted&mdash;and
few could say as much&mdash;by that harsh presence.&nbsp; &ldquo;From
no other&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sirrah, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can die.&nbsp; And you can no more, my lord!&rdquo; the
minister answered bravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no threat can move
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure of that,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, more blandly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But had you listened to me and been less anxious to be brave,
M. La Tribe, where no danger is, you had learned that here is no call
for heroics!&nbsp; Mademoiselle is willing, and will tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With her own lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal raised his eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;With her own lips,
if you will,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And then, advancing a step and addressing
her, with unusual gravity, &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Vrillac,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;you hear what this gentleman requires.&nbsp; Will you be
pleased to confirm what I have said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, and in the intense silence which held the room
in its freezing grasp a woman choked, another broke into weeping.&nbsp;
The colour ebbed from the cheeks of more than one; the men fidgeted
on their feet.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal looked round, his head high.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
no call for tears,&rdquo; he said; and whether he spoke in irony or
in a strange obtuseness was known only to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mademoiselle
is in no hurry&mdash;and rightly&mdash;to answer a question so momentous.&nbsp;
Under the pressure of utmost peril, she passed her word; the more reason
that, now the time has come to redeem it, she should do so at leisure
and after thought.&nbsp; Since she gave her promise, Monsieur, she has
had more than one opportunity of evading its fulfilment.&nbsp; But she
is a Vrillac, and I know that nothing is farther from her thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a moment; and then, &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I would not hurry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were closed, but at that her lips moved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am&mdash;willing,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; And a fluttering sigh,
of relief, of pity, of God knows what, filled the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied, M. La Tribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man!&rdquo;&nbsp; With a growl as of a tiger, Count Hannibal
dropped the mask.&nbsp; In two strides he was at the minister&rsquo;s
side, his hand gripped his shoulder; his face, flushed with passion,
glared into his.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you play with lives?&rdquo; he hissed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you do not value your own, have you no thought of others?&nbsp;
Of these?&nbsp; Look and count!&nbsp; Have you no bowels?&nbsp; If she
will save them, will not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own I do not value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse your own!&rdquo; Tavannes cried in furious scorn.&nbsp;
And he shook the other to and fro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who thought of your
life?&nbsp; Will you doom these?&nbsp; Will you give them to the butcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; La Tribe answered, shaken in spite of himself,
&ldquo;if she be willing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nought to say.&nbsp; But I caught her words indistinctly.&nbsp;
And without her consent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall speak more plainly.&nbsp; Mademoiselle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She anticipated him.&nbsp; She had risen, and stood looking straight
before her, seeing nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; she muttered with a strange gesture,
&ldquo;if it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it must be,&rdquo; she repeated slowly, and with a heavy
sigh.&nbsp; And her chin dropped on her breast.&nbsp; Then, abruptly,
suddenly&mdash;it was a strange thing to see&mdash;she looked up.&nbsp;
A change as complete as the change which had come over Count Hannibal
a minute before came over her.&nbsp; She sprang to his side; she clutched
his arm and devoured his face with her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not
deceiving me?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have Tignonville below?&nbsp;
You&mdash;oh, no, no!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she fell back from him, her eyes
distended, her voice grown suddenly shrill and defiant, &ldquo;You have
not!&nbsp; You are deceiving me!&nbsp; He has escaped, and you have
lied to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have lied to me!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the last fierce
flicker of hope when hope seemed dead: the last clutch of the drowning
at the straw that floated before the eyes.</p>
<p>He laughed harshly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will be my wife in five minutes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and you give me the lie?&nbsp; A week, and you will
know me better!&nbsp; A month, and&mdash;but we will talk of that another
time.&nbsp; For the present,&rdquo; he continued, turning to La Tribe,
&ldquo;do you, sir, tell her that the gentleman is below.&nbsp; Perhaps
she will believe you.&nbsp; For you know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe looked at her sorrowfully; his heart bled for her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have seen M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
M. le Comte says truly.&nbsp; He is in the same case with ourselves,
a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen him?&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him in the room below, when I mounted the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal laughed, the grim mocking laugh which seemed to revel
in the pain it inflicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you have him for a witness?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
could not be a better, for he will not forget.&nbsp; Shall I fetch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head, shivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spare me that,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; And she pressed her hands to her eyes while an uncontrollable
shudder passed over her frame.&nbsp; Then she stepped forward: &ldquo;I
am ready,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do with me as you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>When they had all gone out and closed the door behind them, and the
two whom the minister had joined were left together, Count Hannibal
continued for a time to pace the room, his hands clasped at his back,
and his head sunk somewhat on his chest.&nbsp; His thoughts appeared
to run in a new channel, and one, strange to say, widely diverted from
his bride and from that which he had just done.&nbsp; For he did not
look her way, or, for a time, speak to her.&nbsp; He stood once to snuff
a candle, doing it with an absent face: and once to look, but still
absently, and as if he read no word of it, at the marriage writing which
lay, the ink still wet, upon the table.&nbsp; After each of these interruptions
he resumed his steady pacing to and fro, to and fro, nor did his eye
wander once in the direction of her chair.</p>
<p>And she waited.&nbsp; The conflict of emotions, the strife between
hope and fear, the final defeat had stunned her; had left her exhausted,
almost apathetic.&nbsp; Yet not quite, nor wholly.&nbsp; For when in
his walk he came a little nearer to her, a chill perspiration broke
out on her brow, and shudderings crept over her; and when he passed
farther from her&mdash;and then only, it seemed&mdash;she breathed again.&nbsp;
But the change lay beneath the surface, and cheated the eye.&nbsp; Into
her attitude, as she sat, her hands clasped on her lap, her eyes fixed,
came no apparent change or shadow of movement.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a dull shock, she became aware that he was speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was need of haste,&rdquo; he said, his tone strangely
low and free from emotion, &ldquo;for I am under bond to leave Paris
to-morrow for Angers, whither I bear letters from the King.&nbsp; And
as matters stood, there was no one with whom I could leave you.&nbsp;
I trust Bigot; he is faithful, and you may trust him, Madame, fair or
foul!&nbsp; But he is not quick-witted.&nbsp; Badelon, also, you may
trust.&nbsp; Bear it in mind.&nbsp; Your woman Javette is not faithful;
but as her life is guaranteed she must stay with us until she can be
securely placed.&nbsp; Indeed, I must take all with me&mdash;with one
exception&mdash;for the priests and monks rule Paris, and they do not
love me, nor would spare aught at my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a few moments.&nbsp; Then he resumed in the same tone,
&ldquo;You ought to know how we, Tavannes, stand.&nbsp; It is by Monsieur
and the Queen-Mother; and <i>contra</i> the Guises.&nbsp; We have all
been in this matter; but the latter push and we are pushed, and the
old crack will reopen.&nbsp; As it is, I cannot answer for much beyond
the reach of my arm.&nbsp; Therefore, we take all with us except M.
de Tignonville, who desires to be conducted to the Arsenal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had begun to listen with averted eyes.&nbsp; But as he continued
to speak surprise awoke in her, and something stronger than surprise&mdash;amazement,
stupefaction.&nbsp; Slowly her eyes came to him, and when he ceased
to speak&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you tell me these things?&rdquo; she muttered, her
dry lips framing the words with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it behoves you to know them,&rdquo; he answered, thoughtfully
tapping the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no one, save my brother, whom
I can trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would not ask him why he trusted her, nor why he thought he could
trust her.&nbsp; For a moment or two she watched him, while he, with
his eyes lowered, stood in deep thought.&nbsp; At last he looked up
and his eyes met hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said abruptly, and in a different tone, &ldquo;we
must end this!&nbsp; Is it to be a kiss or a blow between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, though her knees shook under her; and they stood face to
face, her face white as paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;do you mean?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to be a kiss or a blow?&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
husband must be a lover, Madame, or a master, or both!&nbsp; I am content
to be the one or the other, or both, as it shall please you.&nbsp; But
the one I will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, a thousand times, a blow,&rdquo; she cried, her eyes
flaming, &ldquo;from you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered at her courage, but he hid his wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
be it!&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; And before she knew what he would be
at, he struck her sharply across the cheek with the glove which he held
in his hand.&nbsp; She recoiled with a low cry, and her cheek blazed
scarlet where he had struck it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it!&rdquo; he continued sombrely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The choice
shall be yours, but you will come to me daily for the one or the other.&nbsp;
If I cannot be lover, Madame, I will be master.&nbsp; And by this sign
I will have you know it, daily, and daily remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him, her bosom rising and falling, in an astonishment
too deep for words.&nbsp; But he did not heed her.&nbsp; He did not
look at her again.&nbsp; He had already turned to the door, and while
she looked he passed through it, he closed it behind him.&nbsp; And
she was alone.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&nbsp; IN THE ORL&Eacute;ANNAIS.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But you fear him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear him?&rdquo; Madame St. Lo answered; and, to the surprise
of the Countess, she made a little face of contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;No;
why should I fear him?&nbsp; I fear him no more than the puppy leaping
at old Sancho&rsquo;s bridle fears his tall playfellow!&nbsp; Or than
the cloud you see above us fears the wind before which it flies!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She pointed to a white patch, the size of a man&rsquo;s hand, which
hung above the hill on their left hand and formed the only speck in
the blue summer sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear him?&nbsp; Not I!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, laughing gaily, she put her horse at a narrow rivulet which crossed
the grassy track on which they rode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is hard?&rdquo; the Countess murmured in a low voice,
as she regained her companion&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard?&rdquo; Madame St. Lo rejoined with a gesture of pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, hard as the stones in my jewelled ring!&nbsp; Hard as flint,
or the nether millstone&mdash;to his enemies!&nbsp; But to women?&nbsp;
Bah!&nbsp; Who ever heard that he hurt a woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, is he so feared?&rdquo; the Countess asked, her
eyes on the subject of their discussion&mdash;a solitary figure riding
some fifty paces in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he counts no cost!&rdquo; her companion answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because he killed Savillon in the court of the Louvre, though
he knew his life the forfeit.&nbsp; He would have paid the forfeit too,
or lost his right hand, if Monsieur, for his brother the Marshal&rsquo;s
sake, had not intervened.&nbsp; But Savillon had whipped his dog, you
see.&nbsp; Then he killed the Chevalier de Millaud, but &rsquo;twas
in fair fight, in the snow, in their shirts.&nbsp; For that, Millaud&rsquo;s
son lay in wait for him with two, in the passage under the Ch&acirc;telet;
but Hannibal wounded one, and the others saved themselves.&nbsp; Undoubtedly
he is feared!&rdquo; she added with the same note of pride in her voice.</p>
<p>The two who talked, rode at the rear of the little company which
had left Paris at daybreak two days before, by the Porte St. Jacques.&nbsp;
Moving steadily south-westward by the lesser roads and bridle-tracks&mdash;for
Count Hannibal seemed averse from the great road&mdash;they had lain
the second night in a village three leagues from Bonneval.&nbsp; A journey
of two days on fresh horses is apt to change scenery and eye alike;
but seldom has an alteration&mdash;in themselves and all about them&mdash;as
great as that which blessed this little company, been wrought in so
short a time.&nbsp; From the stifling wynds and evil-smelling lanes
of Paris, they had passed to the green uplands, the breezy woods and
babbling streams of the upper Orl&eacute;annais; from sights and sounds
the most appalling, to the solitude of the sandy heath, haunt of the
great bustard, or the sunshine of the hillside, vibrating with the songs
of larks; from an atmosphere of terror and gloom to the freedom of God&rsquo;s
earth and sky.&nbsp; Numerous enough&mdash;they numbered a score of
armed men&mdash;to defy the lawless bands which had their lairs in the
huge forest of Orleans, they halted where they pleased: at mid-day under
a grove of chestnut-trees, or among the willows beside a brook; at night,
if they willed it, under God&rsquo;s heaven.&nbsp; Far, not only from
Paris, but from the great road, with its gibbets and pillories&mdash;the
great road which at that date ran through a waste, no peasant living
willingly within sight of it&mdash;they rode in the morning and in the
evening, resting in the heat of the day.&nbsp; And though they had left
Paris with much talk of haste, they rode more at leisure with every
league.</p>
<p>For whatever Tavannes&rsquo; motive, it was plain that he was in
no hurry to reach his destination.&nbsp; Nor for that matter were any
of his company.&nbsp; Madame St. Lo, who had seized the opportunity
of escaping from the capital under her cousin&rsquo;s escort, was in
an ill-humour with cities, and declaimed much on the joys of a cell
in the woods.&nbsp; For the time the coarsest nature and the dullest
rider had had enough of alarums and conflicts.</p>
<p>The whole company, indeed, though it moved in some fashion of array
with an avant and a rear-guard, the ladies riding together, and Count
Hannibal proceeding solitary in the midst, formed as peaceful a band,
and one as innocently diverted, as if no man of them had ever grasped
pike or blown a match.&nbsp; There was an old rider among them who had
seen the sack of Rome, and the dead face of the great Constable the
idol of the Free Companies.&nbsp; But he had a taste for simples and
much skill in them; and when Madame had once seen Badelon on his knees
in the grass searching for plants, she lost her fear of him.&nbsp; Bigot,
with his low brow and matted hair, was the abject slave of Suzanne,
Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s woman, who twitted him mercilessly on his Norman
<i>patois</i>, and poured the vials of her scorn on him a dozen times
a day.&nbsp; In all, with La Tribe and the Carlats, Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s
servants, and the Countess&rsquo;s following, they numbered not far
short of two score; and when they halted at noon, and under the shadow
of some leafy tree, ate their mid-day meal, or drowsed to the tinkle
of Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s lute, it was difficult to believe that Paris
existed, or that these same people had so lately left its blood-stained
pavements.</p>
<p>They halted this morning a little earlier than usual.&nbsp; Madame
St. Lo had barely answered her companion&rsquo;s question before the
subject of their discussion swung himself from old Sancho&rsquo;s back,
and stood waiting to assist them to dismount.&nbsp; Behind him, where
the green valley through which the road passed narrowed to a rocky gate,
an old mill stood among willows at the foot of a mound.&nbsp; On the
mound behind it a ruined castle which had stood siege in the Hundred
Years&rsquo; War raised its grey walls; and beyond this the stream which
turned the mill poured over rocks with a cool rushing sound that proved
irresistible.&nbsp; The men, their horses watered and hobbled, went
off, shouting like boys, to bathe below the falls; and after a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation Count Hannibal rose from the grass on which he had flung
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guard that for me, Madame,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And he dropped
a packet, bravely sealed and tied with a silk thread, into the Countess&rsquo;s
lap.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be safer than leaving it in my clothes.&nbsp;
Oh&eacute;!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned to Madame St. Lo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would
you fancy a life that was all gipsying, cousin?&rdquo;&nbsp; And if
there was irony in his voice, there was desire in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one happy man in the world,&rdquo; she answered,
with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hermit of Compi&eacute;gne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in a week you would be wild for a masque!&rdquo; he said
cynically.&nbsp; And turning on his heel he followed the men.</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo sighed complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; We are never content, <i>ma
mie</i>!&nbsp; When I am trifling in the Gallery my heart is in the
greenwood.&nbsp; And when I have eaten black bread and drank spring
water for a fortnight I do nothing but dream of Zamet&rsquo;s, and white
mulberry tarts!&nbsp; And you are in the same case.&nbsp; You have saved
your round white neck, or it has been saved for you, by not so much
as the thickness of Zamet&rsquo;s pie-crust&mdash;I declare my mouth
is beginning to water for it!&mdash;and instead of being thankful and
making the best of things, you are thinking of poor Madame d&rsquo;Yverne,
or dreaming of your calf-love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face&mdash;for a girl she was, though they called
her Madame&mdash;began to work.&nbsp; She struggled a moment with her
emotion, and then broke down, and fell to weeping silently.&nbsp; For
two days she had sat in public and not given way.&nbsp; But the reference
to her lover was too much for her strength.</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo looked at her with eyes which were not unkindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sits the wind in that quarter?&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought so!&nbsp; But there, my dear, if you don&rsquo;t put
that packet in your gown you&rsquo;ll wash out the address!&nbsp; Moreover,
if you ask me, I don&rsquo;t think the young man is worth it.&nbsp;
It is only that what we have not got&mdash;we want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young Countess had borne to the limit of her powers.&nbsp;
With an incoherent word she rose to her feet, and walked hurriedly away.&nbsp;
The thought of what was and of what might have been, the thought of
the lover who still&mdash;though he no longer seemed, even to her, the
perfect hero&mdash;held a place in her heart, filled her breast to overflowing.&nbsp;
She longed for some spot where she could weep unseen; where the sunshine
and the blue sky would not mock her grief; and seeing in front of her
a little clump of alders, which grew beside the stream, in a bend that
in winter was marshy, she hastened towards it.</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo saw her figure blend with the shadow of the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite <i>&agrave; la</i> Ronsard, I give my word!&rdquo; she
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now she is out of sight!&nbsp; <i>La, la</i>!&nbsp;
I could play at the game myself, and carve sweet sorrow on the barks
of trees, if it were not so lonesome!&nbsp; And if I had a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And gazing pensively at the stream and the willows, my lady tried
to work herself into a proper frame of mind; now murmuring the name
of one gallant, and now, finding it unsuited, the name of another.&nbsp;
But the soft inflection would break into a giggle, and finally into
a yawn; and, tired of the attempt, she began to pluck grass and throw
it from her.&nbsp; By-and-by she discovered that Madame Carlat and the
women, who had their place a little apart, had disappeared; and affrighted
by the solitude and silence&mdash;for neither of which she was made&mdash;she
sprang up and stared about her, hoping to discern them.&nbsp; Right
and left, however, the sweep of hillside curved upward to the skyline,
lonely and untenanted; behind her the castled rock frowned down on the
rugged gorge and filled it with dispiriting shadow.&nbsp; Madame St.
Lo stamped her foot on the turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little fool!&rdquo; she murmured pettishly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does
she think that I am to be murdered that she may fatten on sighs?&nbsp;
Oh, come up, Madame, you must be dragged out of this!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she started briskly towards the alders, intent on gaining company as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>She had gone about fifty yards, and had as many more to traverse
when she halted.&nbsp; A man, bent double, was moving stealthily along
the farther side of the brook, a little in front of her.&nbsp; Now she
saw him, now she lost him; now she caught a glimpse of him again, through
a screen of willow branches.&nbsp; He moved with the utmost caution,
as a man moves who is pursued or in danger; and for a moment she deemed
him a peasant whom the bathers had disturbed and who was bent on escaping.&nbsp;
But when he came opposite to the alder-bed she saw that that was his
point, for he crouched down, sheltered by a willow, and gazed eagerly
among the trees, always with his back to her; and then he waved his
hand to some one in the wood.</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo drew in her breath.&nbsp; As if he had heard the sound&mdash;which
was impossible&mdash;the man dropped down where he stood, crawled a
yard or two on his face, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Madame stared a moment, expecting to see him or hear him.&nbsp; Then,
as nothing happened, she screamed.&nbsp; She was a woman of quick impulses,
essentially feminine; and she screamed three or four times, standing
where she was, her eyes on the edge of the wood.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that
does not bring her out, nothing will!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>It brought her.&nbsp; An instant, and the Countess appeared, and
hurried in dismay to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the younger woman asked, glancing over
her shoulder; for all the valley, all the hills were peaceful, and behind
Madame St. Lo&mdash;but the lady had not discovered it&mdash;the servants
who had returned were laying the meal.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
she repeated anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; Madame St. Lo asked curtly.&nbsp; She was
quite calm now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess stared a moment, then laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only the
old soldier they call Badelon, gathering simples.&nbsp; Did you think
that he would harm me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not old Badelon whom I saw!&rdquo; Madame St. Lo retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was a younger man, who crept along the other side of the brook,
keeping under cover.&nbsp; When I first saw him he was there,&rdquo;
she continued, pointing to the place.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he crept on and
on until he came opposite to you.&nbsp; Then he waved his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you saw him, who was he?&rdquo; the Countess asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see his face,&rdquo; Madame St. Lo answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he waved to you.&nbsp; That I saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess had a thought which slowly flooded her face with crimson.&nbsp;
Madame St. Lo saw the change, saw the tender light which on a sudden
softened the other&rsquo;s eyes; and the same thought occurred to her.&nbsp;
And having a mind to punish her companion for her reticence&mdash;for
she did not doubt that the girl knew more than she acknowledged&mdash;she
proposed that they should return and find Badelon, and learn if he had
seen the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Madame Tavannes asked.&nbsp; And she stood stubbornly,
her head high.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To clear it up,&rdquo; the elder woman answered mischievously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But perhaps, it were better to tell your husband and let his
men search the coppice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour left the Countess&rsquo;s face as quickly as it had come.&nbsp;
For a moment she was tongue-tied.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we not had enough of seeking and being sought?&rdquo;
she cried, more bitterly than befitted the occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
should we hunt him?&nbsp; I am not timid, and he did me no harm.&nbsp;
I beg, Madame, that you will do me the favour of being silent on the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you insist?&nbsp; But what a pother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see him, and he did not see me,&rdquo; Madame de
Tavannes answered vehemently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fail, therefore, to understand
why we should harass him, whoever he be.&nbsp; Besides, M. de Tavannes
is waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And M. de Tignonville&mdash;is following us!&rdquo; Madame
St. Lo muttered under her breath.&nbsp; And she made a face at the other&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>She was silent, however.&nbsp; They returned to the others and nothing
of import, it would seem, had happened.&nbsp; The soft summer air played
on the meal laid under the willows as it had played on the meal of yesterday
laid under the chestnut-trees.&nbsp; The horses grazed within sight,
moving now and again, with a jingle of trappings or a jealous neigh:
the women&rsquo;s chatter vied with the unceasing sound of the mill-stream.&nbsp;
After dinner, Madame St. Lo touched the lute, and Badelon&mdash;Badelon
who had seen the sack of the Colonna&rsquo;s Palace, and been served
by cardinals on the knee&mdash;fed a water-rat, which had its home in
one of the willow-stumps, with carrot-parings.&nbsp; One by one the
men laid themselves to sleep with their faces on their arms; and to
the eyes all was as all had been yesterday in this camp of armed men
living peacefully.</p>
<p>But not to the Countess!&nbsp; She had accepted her life, she had
resigned herself, she had marvelled that it was no worse.&nbsp; After
the horrors of Paris the calm of the last two days had fallen on her
as balm on a wound.&nbsp; Worn out in body and mind, she had rested,
and only rested; without thought, almost without emotion, save for the
feeling, half fear, half curiosity, which stirred her in regard to the
strange man, her husband.&nbsp; Who on his side left her alone.</p>
<p>But the last hour had wrought a change.&nbsp; Her eyes were grown
restless, her colour came and went.&nbsp; The past stirred in its shallow&mdash;ah,
so shallow&mdash;grave; and dead hopes and dead forebodings, strive
as she might, thrust out hands to plague and torment her.&nbsp; If the
man who sought to speak with her by stealth, who dogged her footsteps
and hung on the skirts of her party, were Tignonville&mdash;her lover,
who at his own request had been escorted to the Arsenal before their
departure from Paris&mdash;then her plight was a sorry one.&nbsp; For
what woman, wedded as she had been wedded, could think otherwise than
indulgently of his persistence?&nbsp; And yet, lover and husband!&nbsp;
What peril, what shame the words had often spelled!&nbsp; At the thought
only she trembled and her colour ebbed.&nbsp; She saw, as one who stands
on the brink of a precipice, the depth which yawned before her.&nbsp;
She asked herself, shivering, if she would ever sink to <i>that</i>.</p>
<p>All the loyalty of a strong nature, all the virtue of a good woman,
revolted against the thought.&nbsp; True, her husband&mdash;husband
she must call him&mdash;had not deserved her love; but his bizarre magnanimity,
the gloomy, disdainful kindness with which he had crowned possession,
even the unity of their interests, which he had impressed upon her in
so strange a fashion, claimed a return in honour.</p>
<p>To be paid&mdash;how? how?&nbsp; That was the crux which perplexed,
which frightened, which harassed her.&nbsp; For, if she told her suspicions,
she exposed her lover to capture by one who had no longer a reason to
be merciful.&nbsp; And if she sought occasion to see Tignonville and
so to dissuade him, she did it at deadly risk to herself.&nbsp; Yet
what other course lay open to her if she would not stand by?&nbsp; If
she would not play the traitor?&nbsp; If she&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;&mdash;it was her husband, and he spoke to her
suddenly,&mdash;&ldquo;are you not well?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, looking up
guiltily, she found his eyes fixed curiously on hers.</p>
<p>Her face turned red and white and red again, and she faltered something
and looked from him, but only to meet Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
My lady laughed softly in sheer mischief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Count Hannibal asked sharply.</p>
<p>But Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s answer was a line of Ronsard.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.&nbsp; ON THE CASTLE HILL.</h2>
<p>Thrice she hummed it, bland and smiling.&nbsp; Then from the neighbouring
group came an interruption.&nbsp; The wine he had drunk had put it into
Bigot&rsquo;s head to snatch a kiss from Suzanne; and Suzanne&rsquo;s
modesty, which was very nice in company, obliged her to squeal.&nbsp;
The uproar which ensued, the men backing the man and the women the woman,
brought Tavannes to his feet.&nbsp; He did not speak, but a glance from
his eyes was enough.&nbsp; There was not one who failed to see that
something was amiss with him, and a sudden silence fell on the party.</p>
<p>He turned to the Countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wished to see the castle?&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go now, but not alone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He cast his eyes over the company, and summoned La Tribe, who was seated
with the Carlats.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go with Madame,&rdquo; he said curtly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has a mind to climb the hill.&nbsp; Bear in mind, we start
at three, and do not venture out of hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, M. le Comte,&rdquo; the minister answered.&nbsp;
He spoke quietly, but there was a strange light in his face as he turned
to go with her.</p>
<p>None the less he was silent until Madame&rsquo;s lagging feet&mdash;for
all her interest in the expedition was gone&mdash;had borne her a hundred
paces from the company.&nbsp; Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knoweth our thoughts and forerunneth all our desires,&rdquo;
he murmured.&nbsp; And when she turned to him, astonished, &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;I have prayed, ah, how I have prayed, for this
opportunity of speaking to you!&nbsp; And it has come.&nbsp; I would
it had come this morning, but it has come.&nbsp; Do not start or look
round; many eyes are on us, and, alas! I have that to say to you which
it will move you to hear, and that to ask of you which it must task
your courage to perform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to tremble, and stood looking up the green slope to the
broken grey wall which crowned its summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she whispered, commanding herself with
an effort.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; If it have aught to do with
M. Tignonville&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her surprise&mdash;for although she had put the question she had
felt no doubt of the answer&mdash;she started and turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has not?&rdquo; she exclaimed almost incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it, Monsieur?&rdquo; she replied, a little haughtily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What can there be that should move me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life or death, Madame,&rdquo; he answered solemnly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nay, more; for since Providence has given me this chance of speaking
to you, a thing of which I despaired, I know that the burden is laid
on us, and that it is guilt or it is innocence, according as we refuse
the burden or bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; she cried impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to speak to you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it you, then, whom Madame St. Lo saw stalking me before
dinner?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped her hands and heaved a sigh of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank
God, Monsieur!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have lifted a weight
from me.&nbsp; I fear nothing in comparison of that.&nbsp; Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he answered sombrely, &ldquo;there is much to
fear, for others if not for ourselves!&nbsp; Do you know what that is
which M. de Tavannes bears always in his belt?&nbsp; What it is he carries
with such care?&nbsp; What it was he handed to you to keep while he
bathed to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letters from the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the import of those letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, should they be written in letters of blood!&rdquo;
the minister exclaimed, his face kindling.&nbsp; &ldquo;They should
scorch the hands that hold them and blister the eyes that read them.&nbsp;
They are the fire and the sword!&nbsp; They are the King&rsquo;s order
to do at Angers as they have done in Paris.&nbsp; To slay all of the
religion who are found there&mdash;and they are many!&nbsp; To spare
none, to have mercy neither on the old man nor the unborn child!&nbsp;
See yonder hawk!&rdquo; he continued, pointing with a shaking hand to
a falcon which hung light and graceful above the valley, the movement
of its wings invisible.&nbsp; &ldquo;How it disports itself in the face
of the sun!&nbsp; How easy its way, how smooth its flight!&nbsp; But
see, it drops upon its prey in the rushes beside the brook, and the
end of its beauty is slaughter!&nbsp; So is it with yonder company!&rdquo;&nbsp;
His finger sank until it indicated the little camp seated toy-like in
the green meadow four hundred feet below them, with every man and horse,
and the very camp-kettle, clear-cut and visible, though diminished by
distance to fairy-like proportions.&nbsp; &ldquo;So it is with yonder
company!&rdquo; he repeated sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;They play and are
merry, and one fishes and another sleeps!&nbsp; But at the end of the
journey is death.&nbsp; Death for their victims, and for them the judgment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood, as he spoke, in the ruined gateway, a walled grass-plot
behind her, and at her feet the stream, the smiling valley, the alders,
and the little camp.&nbsp; The sky was cloudless, the scene drowsy with
the stillness of an August afternoon.&nbsp; But his words went home
so truly that the sunlit landscape before the eyes added one more horror
to the picture he called up before the mind.</p>
<p>The Countess turned white and sick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
she whispered at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are we never to have peace?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And turning from the valley, she walked some distance into the grass
court, and stood.&nbsp; After a time, she turned to him; he had followed
her doggedly, pace for pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo;
she cried, despair in her voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the letters he bears destroyed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, were the letters destroyed,&rdquo; La Tribe answered
relentlessly, &ldquo;he could do nothing!&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; Without
that authority the magistrates of Angers would not move.&nbsp; He could
do nothing.&nbsp; And men and women and children&mdash;men and women
and children whose blood will otherwise cry for vengeance, perhaps for
vengeance on us who might have saved them&mdash;will live!&nbsp; Will
live!&rdquo; he repeated, with a softening eye.&nbsp; And with an all-embracing
gesture he seemed to call to witness the open heavens, the sunshine
and the summer breeze which wrapped them round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew a deep breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you have brought me here,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;to ask me to do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sent here to ask you to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why me?&nbsp; Why me?&rdquo; she wailed, and she held out
her open hands to him, her face wan and colourless.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
come to me, a woman!&nbsp; Why to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are his wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is my husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore he trusts you,&rdquo; was the unyielding, the pitiless
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, and you alone, have the opportunity of doing
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed at him in astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is you who
say that?&rdquo; she faltered, after a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;You who made
us one, who now bid me betray him, whom I have sworn to love?&nbsp;
To ruin him whom I have sworn to honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; he answered solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my head
be the guilt, and on yours the merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but&mdash;&rdquo; she cried quickly, and her eyes glittered
with passion&mdash;&ldquo;do you take both guilt and merit!&nbsp; You
are a man,&rdquo; she continued, her words coming quickly in her excitement,
&ldquo;he is but a man!&nbsp; Why do you not call him aside, trick him
apart on some pretence or other, and when there are but you two, man
to man, wrench the warrant from him?&nbsp; Staking your life against
his, with all those lives for prize?&nbsp; And save them or perish?&nbsp;
Why I, even I, a woman, could find it in my heart to do that, were he
not my husband!&nbsp; Surely you, you who are a man, and young&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am no match for him in strength or arms,&rdquo; the minister
answered sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Else would I do it!&nbsp; Else would I
stake my life, Heaven knows, as gladly to save their lives as I sit
down to meat!&nbsp; But I should fail, and if I failed all were lost.&nbsp;
Moreover,&rdquo; he continued solemnly, &ldquo;I am certified that this
task has been set for you.&nbsp; It was not for nothing, Madame, nor
to save one poor household that you were joined to this man; but to
ransom all these lives and this great city.&nbsp; To be the Judith of
our faith, the saviour of Angers, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&nbsp; Fool!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you
be silent?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stamped the turf passionately, while
her eyes blazed in her white face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no Judith, and
no madwoman as you are fain to make me.&nbsp; Mad?&rdquo; she continued,
overwhelmed with agitation, &ldquo;My God, I would I were, and I should
be free from this!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, turning, she walked a little way
from him with the gesture of one under a crushing burden.</p>
<p>He waited a minute, two minutes, three minutes, and still she did
not return.&nbsp; At length she came back, her bearing more composed;
she looked at him, and her eyes seized his and seemed as if they would
read his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;of what you have told
me?&nbsp; Will you swear that the contents of these letters are as you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live,&rdquo; he answered gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;As God
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know&mdash;of no other way, Monsieur?&nbsp; Of no
other way?&rdquo; she repeated slowly and piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of none, Madame, of none, I swear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sighed deeply, and stood sunk in thought.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;When
do we reach Angers?&rdquo; she asked heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have&mdash;until the day after to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; To-night we lie near Vend&ocirc;me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near a place called La Fl&egrave;che.&nbsp; It is possible,&rdquo;
he went on with hesitation&mdash;for he did not understand her&mdash;&ldquo;that
he may bathe to-morrow, and may hand the packet to you, as he did to-day
when I vainly sought speech with you.&nbsp; If he does that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said, her eyes on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taking will be easy.&nbsp; But when he finds you have
it not&rdquo;&mdash;he faltered anew&mdash;&ldquo;it may go hard with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there, I think, I can help you.&nbsp; If you will stray
from the party, I will meet you and destroy the letter.&nbsp; That done&mdash;and
would God it were done already&mdash;I will take to flight as best I
can, and you will raise the alarm and say that I robbed you of it!&nbsp;
And if you tear your dress&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He looked a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she repeated in a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
betray him I will not lie to him!&nbsp; And no other shall pay the price!&nbsp;
If I ruin him it shall be between him and me, and no other shall have
part in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;what he may do to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; she said proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That will be
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Curious eyes had watched the two as they climbed the hill.&nbsp;
For the path ran up the slope to the gap which served for gate, much
as the path leads up to the Castle Beautiful in old prints of the Pilgrim&rsquo;s
journey, and Madame St. Lo had marked the first halt and the second,
and, noting every gesture, had lost nothing of the interview save the
words.&nbsp; But until the two, after pausing a moment, passed out of
sight she made no sign.&nbsp; Then she laughed.&nbsp; And as Count Hannibal,
at whom the laugh was aimed, did not heed her, she laughed again.&nbsp;
And she hummed the line of Ronsard.</p>
<p>Still he would not be roused, and, piqued, she had recourse to words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what you would do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the
old lover followed us, and she went off with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would not go,&rdquo; he answered coldly, and without looking
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he rode off with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would come back on her feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s prudence was not proof against that.&nbsp;
She had the woman&rsquo;s inclination to hide a woman&rsquo;s secret;
and she had not intended, when she laughed, to do more than play with
the formidable man with whom so few dared to play.&nbsp; Now, stung
by his tone and his assurance, she must needs show him that his trustfulness
had no base.&nbsp; And, as so often happens in the circumstances, she
went a little farther than the facts bore her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way, he has followed us so far!&rdquo; she cried viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; I saw him this morning while you were bathing.&nbsp;
She left me and went into the little coppice.&nbsp; He came down the
other side of the brook, stooping and running, and went to join her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he cross the brook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo blushed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Badelon was there, gathering
simples,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He scared him.&nbsp; And he crawled
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he did not cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I did not say he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor speak to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; But if you think it will pass so next time&mdash;you
do not know much of women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of women generally, not much,&rdquo; he answered, grimly polite.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of this woman a great deal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked in her big eyes, I suppose!&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame
St. Lo cried with heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;And straightway fell down and worshipped
her!&rdquo;&nbsp; She liked rather than disliked the Countess; but she
was of the lightest, and the least opposition drove her out of her course.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you think you know her!&nbsp; And she, if she could save
you from death by opening an eye, would go with a patch on it till her
dying day!&nbsp; Take my word for it, Monsieur, between her and her
lover you will come to harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal&rsquo;s swarthy face darkened a tone, and his eyes
grew a very little smaller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that he runs the greater risk,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may deal with him, but, for her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can deal with her.&nbsp; You deal with some women with a
whip&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would whip me, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would do you
good, Madame.&nbsp; And with other women otherwise.&nbsp; There are
women who, if they are well frightened, will not deceive you.&nbsp;
And there are others who will not deceive you though they are frightened.&nbsp;
Madame de Tavannes is of the latter kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&nbsp; Wait and see!&rdquo;&nbsp; Madame cried in scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&nbsp; And whereas if you had come to me I could have
told her that about M. de Tignonville which would have surprised her,
you will go on waiting and waiting and waiting until one fine day you&rsquo;ll
wake up and find Madame gone, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll take a wife I can whip!&rdquo; he answered,
with a look which apprised her how far she had carried it.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
it will not be you, sweet cousin.&nbsp; For I have no whip heavy enough
for your case.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.&nbsp; SHE WOULD, AND WOULD NOT.</h2>
<p>We noted some way back the ease with which women use one concession
as a stepping-stone to a second; and the lack of magnanimity, amounting
almost to unscrupulousness, which the best display in their dealings
with a retiring foe.&nbsp; But there are concessions which touch even
a good woman&rsquo;s conscience; and Madame de Tavannes, free by the
tenure of a blow, and with that exception treated from hour to hour
with rugged courtesy, shrank appalled before the task which confronted
her.</p>
<p>To ignore what La Tribe had told her, to remain passive when a movement
on her part might save men, women, and children from death, and a whole
city from massacre&mdash;this was a line of conduct so craven, so selfish,
that from the first she knew herself incapable of it.&nbsp; But to take
the only other course open to her, to betray her husband and rob him
of that, the loss of which might ruin him, this needed not courage only,
not devotion only, but a hardness proof against reproaches as well as
against punishment.&nbsp; And the Countess was no fanatic.&nbsp; No
haze of bigotry glorified the thing she contemplated, or dressed it
in colours other than its own.&nbsp; Even while she acknowledged the
necessity of the act and its ultimate righteousness, even while she
owned the obligation which lay upon her to perform it, she saw it as
he would see it, and saw herself as he would see her.</p>
<p>True, he had done her a great wrong; and this in the eyes of some
might pass for punishment.&nbsp; But he had saved her life where many
had perished; and, the wrong done, he had behaved to her with fantastic
generosity.&nbsp; In return for which she was to ruin him?&nbsp; It
was not hard to imagine what he would say of her, and of the reward
with which she had requited him.</p>
<p>She pondered over it as they rode that evening, with the weltering
sun in their eyes and the lengthening shadows of the oaks falling athwart
the bracken which fringed the track.&nbsp; Across breezy heaths and
over downs, through green bottoms and by hamlets, from which every human
creature fled at their approach, they ambled on by twos and threes;
riding in a world of their own, so remote, so different from the real
world&mdash;from which they came and to which they must return&mdash;that
she could have wept in anguish, cursing God for the wickedness of man
which lay so heavy on creation.&nbsp; The gaunt troopers riding at ease
with swinging legs and swaying stirrups&mdash;and singing now a refrain
from Ronsard, and now one of those verses of Marot&rsquo;s psalms which
all the world had sung three decades before&mdash;wore their most lamb-like
aspect.&nbsp; Behind them Madame St. Lo chattered to Suzanne of a riding
mask which had not been brought, or planned expedients, if nothing sufficiently
in the mode could be found at Angers.&nbsp; And the other women talked
and giggled, screamed when they came to fords, and made much of steep
places, where the men must help them.&nbsp; In time of war death&rsquo;s
shadow covers but a day, and sorrow out of sight is out of mind.&nbsp;
Of all the troop whom the sinking sun left within sight of the lofty
towers and vine-clad hills of Vend&ocirc;me, three only wore faces attuned
to the cruel August week just ending; three only, like dark beads strung
far apart on a gay nun&rsquo;s rosary, rode, brooding and silent, in
their places.&nbsp; The Countess was one&mdash;the others were the two
men whose thoughts she filled, and whose eyes now and again sought her,
La Tribe&rsquo;s with sombre fire in their depths, Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
fraught with a gloomy speculation, which belied his brave words to Madame
St. Lo.</p>
<p>He, moreover, as he rode, had other thoughts; dark ones, which did
not touch her.&nbsp; And she, too, had other thoughts at times, dreams
of her young lover, spasms of regret, a wild revolt of heart, a cry
out of the darkness which had suddenly whelmed her.&nbsp; So that of
the three only La Tribe was single-minded.</p>
<p>This day they rode a long league after sunset, through a scattered
oak-wood, where the rabbits sprang up under their horses&rsquo; heads
and the squirrels made angry faces at them from the lower branches.&nbsp;
Night was hard upon them when they reached the southern edge of the
forest, and looked across the dusky open slopes to a distant light or
two which marked where Vend&ocirc;me stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another league,&rdquo; Count Hannibal muttered; and he bade
the men light fires where they were, and unload the packhorses.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pure and dry here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Set
a watch, Bigot, and let two men go down for water.&nbsp; I hear frogs
below.&nbsp; You do not fear to be moonstruck, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer this,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houses are for monks and nuns!&rdquo; he rejoined heartily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give me God&rsquo;s heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The earth is His, but we deface it,&rdquo; she murmured, reverting
to her thoughts, and unconscious that it was to him she spoke.</p>
<p>He looked at her sharply, but the fire was not yet kindled; and in
the gloaming her face was a pale blot undecipherable.&nbsp; He stood
a moment, but she did not speak again; and Madame St. Lo bustling up,
he moved away to give an order.&nbsp; By-and-by the fires burned up,
and showed the pillared aisle in which they sat, small groups dotted
here and there on the floor of Nature&rsquo;s cathedral.&nbsp; Through
the shadowy Gothic vaulting, the groining of many boughs which met overhead,
a rare star twinkled, as through some clerestory window; and from the
dell below rose in the night, now the monotonous chanting of the frogs,
and now, as some great bull-frog took the note, a diapason worthy of
a Brescian organ.&nbsp; The darkness walled all in; the night was still;
a falling caterpillar sounded.&nbsp; Even the rude men at the farthest
fire stilled their voices at times; awed, they knew not why, by the
silence and vastness of the night.</p>
<p>The Countess long remembered that vigil&mdash;for she lay late awake;
the cool gloom, the faint wood-rustlings, the distant cry of fox or
wolf, the soft glow of the expiring fires that at last left the world
to darkness and the stars; above all, the silent wheeling of the planets,
which spoke indeed of a supreme Ruler, but crushed the heart under a
sense of its insignificance, and of the insignificance of all human
revolutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, I believe!&rdquo; she cried, wrestling upwards, wrestling
with herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though I have seen what I have seen, yet
I believe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though she had to bear what she had to bear, and do that from
which her soul shrank!&nbsp; The woman, indeed, within her continued
to cry out against this tragedy ever renewed in her path, against this
necessity for choosing evil, or good, ease for herself or life for others.&nbsp;
But the moving heavens, pointing onward to a time when good and evil
alike should be past, strengthened a nature essentially noble; and before
she slept no shame and no suffering seemed&mdash;for the moment at least&mdash;too
great a price to pay for the lives of little children.&nbsp; Love had
been taken from her life; the pride which would fain answer generosity
with generosity&mdash;that must go, too!</p>
<p>She felt no otherwise when the day came, and the bustle of the start
and the common round of the journey put to flight the ideals of the
night.&nbsp; But things fell out in a manner she had not pictured.&nbsp;
They halted before noon on the north bank of the Loir, in a level meadow
with lines of poplars running this way and that, and filling all the
place with the soft shimmer of leaves.&nbsp; Blue succory, tiny mirrors
of the summer sky, flecked the long grass, and the women picked bunches
of them, or, Italian fashion, twined the blossoms in their hair.&nbsp;
A road ran across the meadow to a ferry, but the ferryman, alarmed by
the aspect of the party, had conveyed his boat to the other side and
hidden himself.</p>
<p>Presently Madame St. Lo espied the boat, clapped her hands and must
have it.&nbsp; The poplars threw no shade, the flies teased her, the
life of a hermit&mdash;in a meadow&mdash;was no longer to her taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go on the water!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Presently
you will go to bathe, Monsieur, and leave us to grill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two livres to the man who will fetch the boat!&rdquo; Count
Hannibal cried.</p>
<p>In less than half a minute three men had thrown off their boots,
and were swimming across, amid the laughter and shouts of their fellows.&nbsp;
In five minutes the boat was brought.</p>
<p>It was not large and would hold no more than four. Tavannes&rsquo;
eye fell on Carlat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand a boat,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go with
Madame St. Lo.&nbsp; And you, M. La Tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are coming?&rdquo; Madame St. Lo cried, turning to
the Countess.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Madame,&rdquo; with a curtsey, &ldquo;you
are not?&nbsp; You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will come,&rdquo; the Countess answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall bathe a short distance up the stream,&rdquo; Count
Hannibal said.&nbsp; He took from his belt the packet of letters, and
as Carlat held the boat for Madame St. Lo to enter, he gave it to the
Countess, as he had given it to her yesterday.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have a care
of it, Madame,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;and do not let
it pass out of your hands.&nbsp; To lose it may be to lose my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colour ebbed from her cheeks.&nbsp; In spite of herself her shaking
hand put back the packet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had you not better then&mdash;give
it to Bigot?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is bathing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him bathe afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered almost harshly; he found a species
of pleasure in showing her that, strange as their relations were, he
trusted her.&nbsp; &ldquo;No; take it, Madame.&nbsp; Only have a care
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it then, hid it in her dress, and he turned away; and she
turned towards the boat.&nbsp; La Tribe stood beside the stern, holding
it for her to enter, and as her fingers rested an instant on his arm
their eyes met.&nbsp; His were alight, his arm even quivered; and she
shuddered.</p>
<p>She avoided looking at him a second time, and this was easy, since
he took his seat in the bows beyond Carlat, who handled the oars.&nbsp;
Silently the boat glided out on the surface of the stream, and floated
downwards, Carlat now and again touching an oar, and Madame St. Lo chattering
gaily in a voice which carried far on the water.&nbsp; Now it was a
flowering rush she must have, now a green bough to shield her face from
the sun&rsquo;s reflection; and now they must lie in some cool, shadowy
pool under fern-clad banks, where the fish rose heavily, and the trickle
of a rivulet fell down over stones.</p>
<p>It was idyllic.&nbsp; But not to the Countess.&nbsp; Her face burned,
her temples throbbed, her fingers gripped the side of the boat in the
vain attempt to steady her pulses.&nbsp; The packet within her dress
scorched her.&nbsp; The great city and its danger, Tavannes and his
faith in her, the need of action, the irrevocableness of action hurried
through her brain.&nbsp; The knowledge that she must act now&mdash;or
never&mdash;pressed upon her with distracting force.&nbsp; Her hand
felt the packet, and fell again nerveless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun has caught you, <i>ma mie</i>,&rdquo; Madame St. Lo
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should ride in a mask as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not one with me,&rdquo; she muttered, her eyes on the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I but an old one.&nbsp; But at Angers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess heard no more; on that word she caught La Tribe&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; He was beckoning to her behind Carlat&rsquo;s back, pointing
imperiously to the water, making signs to her to drop the packet over
the side.&nbsp; When she did not obey&mdash;she felt sick and faint&mdash;she
saw through a mist his brow grow dark.&nbsp; He menaced her secretly.&nbsp;
And still the packet scorched her; and twice her hand went to it, and
dropped again empty.</p>
<p>On a sudden Madame St. Lo cried out.&nbsp; The bank on one side of
the stream was beginning to rise more boldly above the water, and at
the head of the steep thus formed she had espied a late rosebush in
bloom; nothing would now serve but she must land at once and plunder
it.&nbsp; The boat was put in therefore, she jumped ashore, and began
to scale the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with Madame!&rdquo; La Tribe cried, roughly nudging Carlat
in the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not see that she cannot climb the bank?&nbsp;
Up, man, up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess opened her mouth to cry &ldquo;No!&rdquo; but the word
died half-born on her lips; and when the steward looked at her, uncertain
what she had said, she nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go!&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; She was pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, man, go!&rdquo; cried the minister, his eyes burning.&nbsp;
And he almost pushed the other out of the boat.</p>
<p>The next second the craft floated from the bank, and began to drift
downwards.&nbsp; La Tribe waited until a tree interposed and hid them
from the two whom they had left; then he leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Madame!&rdquo; he cried imperiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
God&rsquo;s name, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait!&nbsp; Wait!&nbsp;
I want to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He trusted me!&rdquo; she wailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He trusted
me!&nbsp; How can I do it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, and even while
she spoke, she drew forth the packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven has given you the opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could have stolen it!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he returned, rocking himself to and fro, and
fairly beside himself with impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why steal it?&nbsp;
It is in your hands!&nbsp; You have it!&nbsp; It is Heaven&rsquo;s own
opportunity, it is God&rsquo;s opportunity given to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For he could not read her mind nor comprehend the scruple which held
her hand.&nbsp; He was single-minded.&nbsp; He had but one aim, one
object.&nbsp; He saw the haggard faces of brave men hopeless; he heard
the dying cries of women and children.&nbsp; Such an opportunity of
saving God&rsquo;s elect, of redeeming the innocent, was in his eyes
a gift from Heaven.&nbsp; And having these thoughts and seeing her hesitate&mdash;hesitate
when every movement caused him agony, so imperative was haste, so precious
the opportunity&mdash;he could bear the suspense no longer.&nbsp; When
she did not answer he stooped forward, until his knees touched the thwart
on which Carlat had sat; then, without a word, he flung himself forward,
and, with one hand far extended, grasped the packet.</p>
<p>Had he not moved, she would have done his will; almost certainly
she would have done it.&nbsp; But, thus attacked, she resisted instinctively;
she clung to the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&nbsp; Let go, Monsieur!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she tried to drag the packet from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go, Monsieur!&nbsp; Do you hear?&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
And, with a vigorous jerk, she forced it from him&mdash;he had caught
it by the edge only&mdash;and held it behind her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go back,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me!&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then throw it overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; she cried again, though his face, dark
with passion, glared into hers, and it was clear that the man, possessed
by one idea only, was no longer master of himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go back
to your place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;or I will upset the boat!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, seizing her by the shoulder, he reached over her, striving to take
hold of the packet which she held behind her.&nbsp; The boat rocked;
and, as much in rage as fear, she screamed.</p>
<p>A cry uttered wholly in rage answered hers; it came from Carlat.&nbsp;
La Tribe, however, whose whole mind was fixed on the packet, did not
heed, nor would have heeded, the steward.&nbsp; But the next moment
a second cry, fierce as that of a wild beast, clove the air from the
lower and farther bank; and the Huguenot, recognizing Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
voice, involuntarily desisted and stood erect.&nbsp; A moment the boat
rocked perilously under him; then&mdash;for unheeded it had been drifting
that way&mdash;it softly touched the bank on which Carlat stood staring
and aghast.</p>
<p>La Tribe&rsquo;s chance was gone; he saw that the steward must reach
him before he could succeed in a second attempt.&nbsp; On the other
hand, the undergrowth on the bank was thick, he could touch it with
his hand, and if he fled at once he might escape.</p>
<p>He hung an instant irresolute; then, with a look which went to the
Countess&rsquo;s heart, he sprang ashore, plunged among the alders,
and in a moment was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After him!&nbsp; After him!&rdquo; thundered Count Hannibal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After him, man!&rdquo; and Carlat, stumbling down the steep slope
and through the rough briars, did his best to obey.&nbsp; But in vain.&nbsp;
Before he reached the water&rsquo;s edge, the noise of the fugitive&rsquo;s
retreat had grown faint.&nbsp; A few seconds and it died away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.&nbsp; PLAYING WITH FIRE.</h2>
<p>The impulse of La Tribe&rsquo;s foot as he landed had driven the
boat into the stream.&nbsp; It drifted slowly downward, and if naught
intervened, would take the ground on Count Hannibal&rsquo;s side, a
hundred and fifty yards below him.&nbsp; He saw this, and walked along
the bank, keeping pace with it, while the Countess sat motionless, crouching
in the stern of the craft, her fingers strained about the fatal packet.&nbsp;
The slow glide of the boat, as almost imperceptibly it approached the
low bank; the stillness of the mirror-like surface on which it moved,
leaving only the faintest ripple behind it; the silence&mdash;for under
the influence of emotion Count Hannibal too was mute&mdash;all were
in tremendous contrast with the storm which raged in her breast.</p>
<p>Should she&mdash;should she even now, with his eyes on her, drop
the letters over the side?&nbsp; It needed but a movement.&nbsp; She
had only to extend her hand, to relax the tension of her fingers, and
the deed was done.&nbsp; It needed only that; but the golden sands of
opportunity were running out&mdash;were running out fast.&nbsp; Slowly
and more slowly, silently and more silently, the boat slid in towards
the bank on which he stood, and still she hesitated.&nbsp; The stillness,
and the waiting figure, and the watching eyes now but a few feet distant,
weighed on her and seemed to paralyze her will.&nbsp; A foot, another
foot!&nbsp; A moment and it would be too late, the last of the sands
would have run out.&nbsp; The bow of the boat rustled softly through
the rushes; it kissed the bank.&nbsp; And her hand still held the letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not hurt?&rdquo; he asked curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
scoundrel might have drowned you.&nbsp; Was he mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent.&nbsp; He held out his hand, and she gave him the
packet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you much,&rdquo; he said, a ring of gaiety, almost of
triumph, in his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;More than you guess, Madame.&nbsp;
God made you for a soldier&rsquo;s wife, and a mother of soldiers.&nbsp;
What?&nbsp; You are not well, I am afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could sit down a minute,&rdquo; she faltered.&nbsp; She
was swaying on her feet.</p>
<p>He supported her across the belt of meadow which fringed the bank,
and made her recline against a tree.&nbsp; Then as his men began to
come up&mdash;for the alarm had reached them&mdash;he would have sent
two of them in the boat to fetch Madame St. Lo to her.&nbsp; But she
would not let him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your maid, then?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur, I need only to be alone a little!&nbsp; Only
to be alone,&rdquo; she repeated, her face averted; and believing this
he sent the men away, and, taking the boat himself, he crossed over,
took in Madame St. Lo and Carlat, and rowed them to the ferry.&nbsp;
Here the wildest rumours were current.&nbsp; One held that the Huguenot
had gone out of his senses; another, that he had watched for this opportunity
of avenging his brethren; a third, that his intention had been to carry
off the Countess and hold her to ransom.&nbsp; Only Tavannes himself,
from his position on the farther bank, had seen the packet of letters,
and the hand which withheld them; and he said nothing.&nbsp; Nay, when
some of the men would have crossed to search for the fugitive, he forbade
them, he scarcely knew why, save that it might please her; and when
the women would have hurried to join her and hear the tale from her
lips he forbade them also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes to be alone,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; Madame St. Lo cried, in a fever of curiosity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her dead, or worse!&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Leave
a woman alone after such a fright as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame laughed cynically; and the laugh brought a tinge of colour
to his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, does she?&rdquo; she sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I understand!&nbsp;
Have a care, have a care, or one of these days, Monsieur, when you leave
her alone, you&rsquo;ll find them together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; she returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only when
it happens don&rsquo;t say that you were not warned.&nbsp; You think
that she does not hear from him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; The words were wrung from him.</p>
<p>Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s contempt passed all limits.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
can she!&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You trail a woman across
France, and let her sit by herself, and lie by herself, and all but
drown by herself, and you ask how she hears from her lover?&nbsp; You
leave her old servants about her, and you ask how she communicates with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know nothing!&rdquo; he snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this,&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw her sitting
this morning, and smiling and weeping at the same time!&nbsp; Was she
thinking of you, Monsieur?&nbsp; Or of him?&nbsp; She was looking at
the hills through tears; a blue mist hung over them, and I&rsquo;ll
wager she saw some one&rsquo;s eyes gazing and some one&rsquo;s hand
beckoning out of the blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he cried, tormented in spite of himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You love to make mischief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she answered swiftly.&nbsp; &ldquo;For &rsquo;twas
not I made the match.&nbsp; But go your way, go your way, Monsieur,
and see what kind of a welcome you&rsquo;ll get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Count Hannibal growled.&nbsp; And he started
along the bank to rejoin his wife.</p>
<p>The light in his eyes had died down.&nbsp; Yet would they have been
more sombre, and his face more harsh, had he known the mind of the woman
to whom he was hastening.&nbsp; The Countess had begged to be left alone;
alone, she found the solitude she had craved a cruel gift.&nbsp; She
had saved the packet.&nbsp; She had fulfilled her trust.&nbsp; But only
to experience, the moment the deed was done, the full poignancy of remorse.&nbsp;
Before the act, while the choice had lain with her, the betrayal of
her husband had loomed large; now she saw that to treat him as she had
treated him was the true betrayal, and that even for his own sake, and
to save him from a fearful sin, it had become her to destroy the letters.</p>
<p>Now, it was no longer her duty to him which loomed large, but her
duty to the innocent, to the victims of the massacre which she might
have stayed, to the people of her faith whom she had abandoned, to the
women and children whose death-warrant she had preserved.&nbsp; Now,
she perceived that a part more divine had never fallen to woman, nor
a responsibility so heavy been laid upon woman.&nbsp; Nor guilt more
dread!</p>
<p>She writhed in misery, thinking of it.&nbsp; What had she done?&nbsp;
She could hear afar off the sounds of the camp; an occasional outcry,
a snatch of laughter.&nbsp; And the cry and the laughter rang in her
ears, a bitter mockery.&nbsp; This summer camp, to what was it the prelude?&nbsp;
This forbearance on her husband&rsquo;s part, in what would it end?&nbsp;
Were not the one and the other cruel make-believes?&nbsp; Two days,
and the men who laughed beside the water would slay and torture with
equal zest.&nbsp; A little, and the husband who now chose to be generous
would show himself in his true colours.&nbsp; And it was for the sake
of such as these that she had played the coward.&nbsp; That she had
laid up for herself endless remorse.&nbsp; That henceforth the cries
of the innocent would haunt her dreams.</p>
<p>Racked by such thoughts she did not hear his step, and it was his
shadow falling across her feet which first warned her of his presence.&nbsp;
She looked up, saw him, and involuntarily recoiled.&nbsp; Then, seeing
the change in his face&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Monsieur,&rdquo; she stammered, affrighted, her hand pressed
to her side, &ldquo;I ask your pardon!&nbsp; You startled me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; And he stood over her
regarding her dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite&mdash;myself yet,&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
His look told her that her start had betrayed her feelings.</p>
<p>Alas! the plan of taking a woman by force has drawbacks, and among
others this one: that he must be a sanguine husband who deems her heart
his, and a husband without jealousy, whose suspicions are not aroused
by the faintest flush or the lightest word.&nbsp; He knows that she
is his unwillingly, a victim, not a mistress; and behind every bush
beside the road and behind every mask in the crowd he espies a rival.</p>
<p>Moreover, where women are in question, who is always strong?&nbsp;
Or who can say how long he will pursue this plan or that?&nbsp; A man
of sternest temper, Count Hannibal had set out on a path of conduct
carefully and deliberately chosen; knowing&mdash;and he still knew&mdash;that
if he abandoned it he had little to hope, if the less to fear.&nbsp;
But the proof of fidelity which the Countess had just given him had
blown to a white heat the smouldering flame in his heart, and Madame
St. Lo&rsquo;s gibes, which should have fallen as cold water alike on
his hopes and his passion, had but fed the desire to know the best.&nbsp;
For all that, he might not have spoken now, if he had not caught her
look of affright; strange as it sounds, that look, which of all things
should have silenced him and warned him that the time was not yet, stung
him out of patience.&nbsp; Suddenly the man in him carried him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still fear me, then?&rdquo; he said, in a voice hoarse
and unnatural.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it for what I do or for what I leave
undone that you hate me, Madame?&nbsp; Tell me, I beg, for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For neither!&rdquo; she said, trembling.&nbsp; His eyes, hot
and passionate, were on her, and the blood had mounted to his brow.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For neither!&nbsp; I do not hate you, Monsieur!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fear me then?&nbsp; I am right in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear&mdash;that which you carry with you,&rdquo; she stammered,
speaking on impulse and scarcely knowing what she said.</p>
<p>He started, and his expression changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;So?&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;So?&nbsp; You know what I carry, do you?&nbsp;
And from whom?&nbsp; From whom,&rdquo; he continued in a tone of menace,
&ldquo;if you please, did you get that knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From M. La Tribe,&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; She had not meant
to tell him.&nbsp; Why had she told him?</p>
<p>He nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might have known it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I more than suspected it.&nbsp; Therefore I should be the more
beholden to you for saving the letters.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;he paused
and laughed harshly&mdash;&ldquo;it was out of no love for me you saved
them.&nbsp; That too I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer or protest; and when he had waited a moment in
vain expectation of her protest, a cruel look crept into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;do you never reflect
that you may push the part you play too far?&nbsp; That the patience,
even of the worst of men, does not endure for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your word!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do not fear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your word,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; And now she looked
him bravely in the face, her eyes full of the courage of her race.</p>
<p>The lines of his mouth hardened as he met her look.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what have I of yours?&rdquo; he said in a low voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
have I of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face began to burn at that, her eyes fell and she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gratitude,&rdquo; she murmured, with an upward look that
prayed for pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;God knows, Monsieur, you have that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows I do not want it!&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; And
he laughed derisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your gratitude!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he mocked her tone rudely and coarsely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your gratitude!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then for a minute&mdash;for so long a time that she began to wonder
and to quake&mdash;he was silent.&nbsp; At last, &ldquo;A fig for your
gratitude,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want your love!&nbsp; I suppose&mdash;cold
as you are, and a Huguenot&mdash;you can love like other women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first, the very first time he had used the word to her;
and though it fell from his lips like a threat, though he used it as
a man presents a pistol, she flushed anew from throat to brow.&nbsp;
But she did not quail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not mine to give,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur,&rdquo; she answered, wondering at her courage,
at her audacity, her madness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it cannot be mine&mdash;at any time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head, trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, suddenly reaching forward, he gripped
her wrist in an iron grasp.&nbsp; There was passion in his tone.&nbsp;
His eyes burned her.</p>
<p>Whether it was that set her on another track, or pure despair, or
the cry in her ears of little children and of helpless women, something
in a moment inspired her, flashed in her eyes and altered her voice.&nbsp;
She raised her head and looked him firmly in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you mean by love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he answered brutally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;it may be, Monsieur,&rdquo; she returned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is a way if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke she rose slowly to her feet; for in his surprise he
had released her wrist.&nbsp; He rose with her, and they stood confronting
one another on the strip of grass between the river and the poplars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I will?&rdquo;&nbsp; His form seemed to dilate, his eyes
devoured her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will give me
the letters that are in your belt, the packet which I saved to-day&mdash;that
I may destroy them&mdash;I will be yours freely and willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath, still devouring her with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked him in the face as she spoke,
and her cheeks were white, not red.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only&mdash;the letters!&nbsp;
Give me the letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for them you will give me your love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes flickered, and involuntarily she shivered.&nbsp; A faint
blush rose and dyed her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only God can give love,&rdquo; she said, her tone low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yours is given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is his.&nbsp; And yet for these letters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these lives!&rdquo; she cried proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;if you will give them
to me!&nbsp; If you will give them to me,&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
And she held out her hands; her face, full of passion, was bright with
a strange light.&nbsp; A close observer might have thought her distraught;
still excited by the struggle in the boat, and barely mistress of herself.</p>
<p>But the man whom she tempted, the man who held her price at his belt,
after one searching look at her turned from her; perhaps because he
could not trust himself to gaze on her.&nbsp; Count Hannibal walked
a dozen paces from her and returned, and again a dozen paces and returned;
and again a third time, with something fierce and passionate in his
gait.&nbsp; At last he stopped before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to offer for them,&rdquo; he said, in a cold,
hard tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing that is not mine already, nothing that
is not my right, nothing that I cannot take at my will.&nbsp; My word?&rdquo;
he continued, seeing her about to interrupt him.&nbsp; &ldquo;True,
Madame, you have it, you had it.&nbsp; But why need I keep my word to
you, who tempt me to break my word to the King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a weak gesture with her hands.&nbsp; Her head had sunk on
her breast&mdash;she seemed dazed by the shock of his contempt, dazed
by his reception of her offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saved the letters?&rdquo; he continued, interpreting her
action.&nbsp; &ldquo;True, but the letters are mine, and that which
you offer for them is mine also.&nbsp; You have nothing to offer.&nbsp;
For the rest, Madame,&rdquo; he went on, eyeing her cynically, &ldquo;you
surprise me!&nbsp; You, whose modesty and virtue are so great, would
corrupt your husband, would sell yourself, would dishonour the love
of which you boast so loudly, the love that only God gives!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He laughed derisively as he quoted her words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, and,
after showing at how low a price you hold yourself, you still look,
I doubt not, to me to respect you, and to keep my word.&nbsp; Madame!&rdquo;
in a terrible voice, &ldquo;do not play with fire!&nbsp; You saved my
letters, it is true!&nbsp; And for that, for this time, you shall go
free, if God will help me to let you go!&nbsp; But tempt me not!&nbsp;
Tempt me not!&rdquo; he repeated, turning from her and turning back
again with a gesture of despair, as if he mistrusted the strength of
the restraint which he put upon himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no more than
other men!&nbsp; Perhaps I am less.&nbsp; And you&mdash;you who prate
of love, and know not what love is&mdash;could love! could love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped on that word as if the word choked him&mdash;stopped,
struggling with his passion.&nbsp; At last, with a half-stifled oath,
he flung away from her, halted and hung a moment, then, with a swing
of rage, went off again violently.&nbsp; His feet as he strode along
the river-bank trampled the flowers, and slew the pale water forget-me-not,
which grew among the grasses.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&nbsp; A MIND, AND NOT A MIND.</h2>
<p>La Tribe tore through the thicket, imagining Carlat and Count Hannibal
hot on his heels.&nbsp; He dared not pause even to listen.&nbsp; The
underwood tripped him, the lissom branches of the alders whipped his
face and blinded him; once he fell headlong over a moss-grown stone,
and picked himself up groaning.&nbsp; But the hare hard-pushed takes
no account of the briars, nor does the fox heed the mud through which
it draws itself into covert.&nbsp; And for the time he was naught but
a hunted beast.&nbsp; With elbows pinned to his sides, or with hands
extended to ward off the boughs, with bursting lungs and crimson face,
he plunged through the tangle, now slipping downwards, now leaping upwards,
now all but prostrate, now breasting a mass of thorns.&nbsp; On and
on he ran, until he came to the verge of the wood, saw before him an
open meadow devoid of shelter or hiding-place, and with a groan of despair
cast himself flat.&nbsp; He listened.&nbsp; How far were they behind
him?</p>
<p>He heard nothing&mdash;nothing, save the common noises of the wood,
the angry chatter of a disturbed blackbird as it flew low into hiding,
or the harsh notes of a flock of starlings as they rose from the meadow.&nbsp;
The hum of bees filled the air, and the August flies buzzed about his
sweating brow, for he had lost his cap.&nbsp; But behind him&mdash;nothing.&nbsp;
Already the stillness of the wood had closed upon his track.</p>
<p>He was not the less panic-stricken.&nbsp; He supposed that Tavannes&rsquo;
people were getting to horse, and calculated that, if they surrounded
and beat the wood, he must be taken.&nbsp; At the thought, though he
had barely got his breath, he rose, and keeping within the coppice crawled
down the slope towards the river.&nbsp; Gently, when he reached it,
he slipped into the water, and stooping below the level of the bank,
his head and shoulders hidden by the bushes, he waded down stream until
he had put another hundred and fifty yards between himself and pursuit.&nbsp;
Then he paused and listened.&nbsp; Still he heard nothing, and he waded
on again, until the water grew deep.&nbsp; At this point he marked a
little below him a clump of trees on the farther side; and reflecting
that that side&mdash;if he could reach it unseen&mdash;would be less
suspect, he swam across, aiming for a thorn bush which grew low to the
water.&nbsp; Under its shelter he crawled out, and, worming himself
like a snake across the few yards of grass which intervened, he stood
at length within the shadow of the trees.&nbsp; A moment he paused to
shake himself, and then, remembering that he was still within a mile
of the camp, he set off, now walking, and now running in the direction
of the hills which his party had crossed that morning.</p>
<p>For a time he hurried on, thinking only of escape.&nbsp; But when
he had covered a mile or two, and escape seemed probable, there began
to mingle with his thankfulness a bitter&mdash;a something which grew
more bitter with each moment.&nbsp; Why had he fled and left the work
undone?&nbsp; Why had he given way to unworthy fear, when the letters
were within his grasp?&nbsp; True, if he had lingered a few seconds
longer, he would have failed to make good his escape; but what of that
if in those seconds he had destroyed the letters, he had saved Angers,
he had saved his brethren?&nbsp; Alas! he had played the coward.&nbsp;
The terror of Tavannes&rsquo; voice had unmanned him.&nbsp; He had saved
himself and left the flock to perish; he, whom God had set apart by
many and great signs for this work!</p>
<p>He had commonly courage enough.&nbsp; He could have died at the stake
for his convictions.&nbsp; But he had not the presence of mind which
is proof against a shock, nor the cool judgment which, in the face of
death, sees to the end of two roads.&nbsp; He was no coward, but now
he deemed himself one, and in an agony of remorse he flung himself on
his face in the long grass.&nbsp; He had known trials and temptations,
but hitherto he had held himself erect; now, like Peter, he had betrayed
his Lord.</p>
<p>He lay an hour groaning in the misery of his heart, and then he fell
on the text &ldquo;Thou art Peter, and on this rock&mdash;&rdquo; and
he sat up.&nbsp; Peter had betrayed his trust through cowardice&mdash;as
he had.&nbsp; But Peter had not been held unworthy.&nbsp; Might it not
be so with him?&nbsp; He rose to his feet, a new light in his eyes.&nbsp;
He would return!&nbsp; He would return, and at all costs, even at the
cost of surrendering himself, he would obtain access to the letters.&nbsp;
And then&mdash;not the fear of Count Hannibal, not the fear of instant
death, should turn him from his duty.</p>
<p>He had cast himself down in a woodland glade which lay near the path
along which he had ridden that morning.&nbsp; But the mental conflict
from which he rose had shaken him so violently that he could not recall
the side on which he had entered the clearing, and he turned himself
about, endeavouring to remember.&nbsp; At that moment the light jingle
of a bridle struck his ear; he caught through the green bushes the flash
and sparkle of harness.&nbsp; They had tracked him then, they were here!&nbsp;
So had he clear proof that this second chance was to be his.&nbsp; In
a happy fervour he stood forward where the pursuers could not fail to
see him.</p>
<p>Or so he thought.&nbsp; Yet the first horseman, riding carelessly
with his face averted and his feet dangling, would have gone by and
seen nothing if his horse, more watchful, had not shied.&nbsp; The man
turned then; and for a moment the two stared at one another between
the pricked ears of the horse.&nbsp; At last&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. de Tignonville!&rdquo; the minister ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La Tribe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truly you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I think so,&rdquo; the young man answered.</p>
<p>The minister lifted up his eyes and seemed to call the trees and
the clouds and the birds to witness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I know that I am chosen!&nbsp;
And that we were instruments to do this thing from the day when the
hen saved us in the haycart in Paris!&nbsp; Now I know that all is forgiven
and all is ordained, and that the faithful of Angers shall to-morrow
live and not die!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a face radiant, yet solemn,
he walked to the young man&rsquo;s stirrup.</p>
<p>An instant Tignonville looked sharply before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
far ahead are they?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; His tone, hard and matter-of-fact,
was little in harmony with the other&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are resting a league before you, at the ferry.&nbsp;
You are in pursuit of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s look as he spoke was
grim.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have five behind me&mdash;of your kidney, M. la
Tribe.&nbsp; They are from the Arsenal.&nbsp; They have lost one his
wife, and one his son.&nbsp; The three others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweethearts,&rdquo; Tignonville answered dryly.&nbsp; And
he cast a singular look at the minister.</p>
<p>But La Tribe&rsquo;s mind was so full of one matter, he could think
only of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you hear of the letters?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why are you following him?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Tignonville echoed, a look of hate darkening his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you ask why we follow&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But
on the name he seemed to choke and was silent.</p>
<p>By this time his men had come up, and one answered for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we following Hannibal de Tavannes?&rdquo; he said
sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;To do to him as he has done to us!&nbsp; To rob
him as he has robbed us&mdash;of more than gold!&nbsp; To kill him as
he has killed ours, foully and by surprise!&nbsp; In his bed if we can!&nbsp;
In the arms of his wife if God wills it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker&rsquo;s face was haggard from brooding and lack of sleep,
but his eyes glowed and burned, as his fellows growled assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis simple why we follow,&rdquo; a second put in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is there a man of our faith who will not, when he hears the tale,
rise up and stab the nearest of this black brood&mdash;though it be
his brother?&nbsp; If so, God&rsquo;s curse on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, and so only,&rdquo; cried the first, &ldquo;shall there
be faith in our land!&nbsp; And our children, our little maids, shall
lie safe in their beds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker&rsquo;s chin sank on his breast, and with his last word
the light died out of his eyes.&nbsp; La Tribe looked at him curiously,
then at the others.&nbsp; Last of all at Tignonville, on whose face
he fancied that he surprised a faint smile.&nbsp; Yet Tignonville&rsquo;s
tone when he spoke was grave enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you blame
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; the minister answered, shivering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
cannot.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had been for a while beyond the range of these
feelings; and in the greenwood, under God&rsquo;s heaven, with the sunshine
about him, they jarred on him.&nbsp; Yet he could not blame men who
had suffered as these had suffered; who were maddened, as these were
maddened, by the gravest wrongs which it is possible for one man to
inflict on another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; he continued sorrowfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But in God&rsquo;s name I offer you a higher and a nobler errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need none,&rdquo; Tignonville muttered impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet many others need you,&rdquo; La Tribe answered in a tone
of rebuke.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not aware that the man you follow bears
a packet from the King for the hands of the magistrates of Angers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&nbsp; Does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bidding them do at Angers as his Majesty has done in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men broke into cries of execration.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he shall
not see Angers!&rdquo; they swore.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood that he has
shed shall choke him by the way!&nbsp; And as he would do to others
it shall be done to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe shuddered as he listened, as he looked.&nbsp; Try as he
would, the thirst of these men for vengeance appalled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has a score and more
with him and you are only six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven now,&rdquo; Tignonville answered with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he lies to-night at La Fl&egrave;che?&nbsp; That is so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his intention this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the old King&rsquo;s Inn at the meeting of the great roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mentioned,&rdquo; La Tribe admitted, with a reluctance
he did not comprehend.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if the night be fair he is as
like as not to lie in the fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men pointed to the sky.&nbsp; A dark bank of cloud fresh
risen from the ocean, and big with tempest, hung low in the west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&nbsp; God will deliver him into our hands!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>Tignonville nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he lie there,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;He will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then to one of his followers, as he
dismounted, &ldquo;Do you ride on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and stand
guard that we be not surprised.&nbsp; And do you, Perrot, tell Monsieur.&nbsp;
Perrot here, as God wills it,&rdquo; he added, with the faint smile
which did not escape the minister&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo;married his wife
from the great inn at La Fl&egrave;che, and he knows the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None better,&rdquo; the man growled.&nbsp; He was a sullen,
brooding knave, whose eyes when he looked up surprised by their savage
fire.</p>
<p>La Tribe shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know it, too,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strong as a fortress, with a walled court, and all
the windows look inwards.&nbsp; The gates are closed an hour after sunset,
no matter who is without.&nbsp; If you think, M. de Tignonville, to
take him there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Monsieur, you have not heard me,&rdquo; Perrot interposed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know it after another fashion.&nbsp; Do you remember a rill
of water which runs through the great yard and the stables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grated with iron at either end and no passage for so much
as a dog?&nbsp; You do?&nbsp; Well, Monsieur, I have hunted rats there,
and where the water passes under the wall is a culvert, a man&rsquo;s
height in length.&nbsp; In it is a stone, one of those which frame the
grating at the entrance, which a strong man can remove&mdash;and the
man is in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, in!&nbsp; But where?&rdquo; La Tribe asked, his eyebrows
drawn together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, Monsieur, where?&rdquo; Perrot rejoined in a tone
of triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;There lies the point.&nbsp; In the stables,
where will be sleeping men, and a snorer on every truss?&nbsp; No, but
in a fairway between two stables where the water at its entrance runs
clear in a stone channel; a channel deepened in one place that they
may draw for the chambers above with a rope and a bucket.&nbsp; The
rooms above are the best in the house, four in one row, opening all
on the gallery; which was uncovered, in the common fashion until Queen-Mother
Jezebel, passing that way to Nantes, two years back, found the chambers
draughty; and that end of the gallery was closed in against her return.&nbsp;
Now, Monsieur, he and his Madame will lie there; and he will feel safe,
for there is but one way to those four rooms&mdash;through the door
which shuts off the covered gallery from the open part.&nbsp; But&mdash;&rdquo;
he glanced up an instant and La Tribe caught the smouldering fire in
his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;we shall not go in by the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bucket rises through a trap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the gallery?&nbsp; To be sure, monsieur.&nbsp; In the corner
beyond the fourth door.&nbsp; There shall he fall into the pit which
he dug for others, and the evil that he planned rebound on his own head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you of it?&rdquo; Tignonville asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it is cleverly planned,&rdquo; the minister answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more until I have eaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get him something!&rdquo; Tignonville replied in a surly tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And we may as well eat, ourselves.&nbsp; Lead the horses into
the wood.&nbsp; And do you, Perrot, call Tuez-les-Moines, who is forward.&nbsp;
Two hours&rsquo; riding should bring us to La Fl&egrave;che.&nbsp; We
need not leave here, therefore, until the sun is low.&nbsp; To dinner!&nbsp;
To dinner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably he did not feel the indifference he affected, for his face
as he ate grew darker, and from time to time he shot a glance, barbed
with suspicion, at the minister.&nbsp; La Tribe on his side remained
silent, although the men ate apart.&nbsp; He was in doubt, indeed, as
to his own feelings.&nbsp; His instinct and his reason were at odds.&nbsp;
Through all, however, a single purpose, the rescue of Angers, held good,
and gradually other things fell into their places.&nbsp; When the meal
was at an end, and Tignonville challenged him, he was ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your enthusiasm seems to have waned,&rdquo; the younger man
said with a sneer, &ldquo;since we met, monsieur!&nbsp; May I ask now
if you find any fault with the plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the plan, none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was Providence brought us together, was it not Providence
furnished me with Perrot who knows La Fl&egrave;che?&nbsp; If it was
Providence brought the danger of the faithful in Angers to your knowledge,
was it not Providence set us on the road&mdash;without whom you had
been powerless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in His name, what is the matter?&rdquo; Tignonville
rejoined with a passion of which the other&rsquo;s manner seemed an
inadequate cause.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will you!&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would take your place,&rdquo; La Tribe answered quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are we too many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are enough without you, M. Tignonville,&rdquo; the minister
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;These men, who have wrongs to avenge, God will
justify them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;And have
I no wrongs to avenge?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it nothing to
lose my mistress, to be robbed of my wife, to see the woman I love dragged
off to be a slave and a toy?&nbsp; Are these no wrongs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spared your life, if he did not save it,&rdquo; the minister
said solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And hers.&nbsp; And her servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To suit himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe spread out his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To suit himself!&nbsp; And for that you wish him to go free?&rdquo;
Tignonville cried in a voice half-choked with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you know that this man, and this man alone, stood forth in the great
Hall of the Louvre, and when even the King flinched, justified the murder
of our people?&nbsp; After that is he to go free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your hands,&rdquo; La Tribe answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
alone of our people must not pursue him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have
added more, but Tignonville would not listen.</p>
<p>Brooding on his wrongs behind the wall of the Arsenal, he had let
hatred eat away his more generous instincts.&nbsp; Vain and conceited,
he fancied that the world laughed at the poor figure he had cut; and
the wound in his vanity festered until nothing would serve but to see
the downfall of his enemy.&nbsp; Instant pursuit, instant vengeance&mdash;only
these, he fancied, could restore him in his fellows&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>In his heart he knew what would become him better.&nbsp; But vanity
is a potent motive: and his conscience, even when supported by La Tribe,
struggled but weakly.&nbsp; From neither would he hear more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have travelled with him, until you side with him!&rdquo;
he cried violently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have a care, monsieur, have a care,
lest we think you papist!&rdquo;&nbsp; And walking over to the men,
he bade them saddle; adding a sour word which turned their eyes, in
no friendly gaze, on the minister.</p>
<p>After that La Tribe said no more.&nbsp; Of what use would it have
been?</p>
<p>But as darkness came on and cloaked the little troop, and the storm
which the men had foreseen began to rumble in the west, his distaste
for the business waxed.&nbsp; The summer lightning which presently began
to play across the sky revealed not only the broad gleaming stream,
between which and a wooded hill their road ran, but the faces of his
companions; and these, in their turn, shed a grisly light on the bloody
enterprise towards which they were set.&nbsp; Nervous and ill at ease,
the minister&rsquo;s mind dwelt on the stages of that enterprise: the
stealthy entrance through the waterway, the ascent through the trap,
the surprise, the slaughter in the sleeping-chamber.&nbsp; And either
because he had lived for days in the victim&rsquo;s company, or was
swayed by the arguments he had addressed to another, the prospect shook
his soul.</p>
<p>In vain he told himself that this was the oppressor; he saw only
the man, fresh roused from sleep, with the horror of impending dissolution
in his eyes.&nbsp; And when the rider, behind whom he sat, pointed to
a faint spark of light, at no great distance before them, and whispered
that it was St. Agnes&rsquo;s Chapel, hard by the inn, he could have
cried with the best Catholic of them all, &ldquo;Inter pontem et fontem,
Domine!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, some such words did pass his lips.</p>
<p>For the man before him turned halfway in his saddle.&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>But the Huguenot did not explain.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&nbsp; AT THE KING&rsquo;S INN.</h2>
<p>The Countess sat up in the darkness of the chamber.&nbsp; She had
writhed since noon under the stings of remorse; she could bear them
no longer.&nbsp; The slow declension of the day, the evening light,
the signs of coming tempest which had driven her company to the shelter
of the inn at the crossroads, all had racked her, by reminding her that
the hours were flying, and that soon the fault she had committed would
be irreparable.&nbsp; One impulsive attempt to redeem it she had made;
but it had failed, and, by rendering her suspect, had made reparation
more difficult.&nbsp; Still, by daylight it had seemed possible to rest
content with the trial made; not so now, when night had fallen, and
the cries of little children and the haggard eyes of mothers peopled
the darkness of her chamber.&nbsp; She sat up, and listened with throbbing
temples.</p>
<p>To shut out the lightning which played at intervals across the heavens,
Madame St. Lo, who shared the room, had covered the window with a cloak;
and the place was dark.&nbsp; To exclude the dull roll of the thunder
was less easy, for the night was oppressively hot, and behind the cloak
the casement was open.&nbsp; Gradually, too, another sound, the hissing
fall of heavy rain, began to make itself heard, and to mingle with the
regular breathing which proved that Madame St. Lo slept.</p>
<p>Assured of this fact, the Countess presently heaved a sigh, and slipped
from the bed.&nbsp; She groped in the darkness for her cloak, found
it, and donned it over her night gear.&nbsp; Then, taking her bearings
by her bed, which stood with its head to the window and its foot to
the entrance, she felt her way across the floor to the door, and after
passing her hands a dozen times over every part of it, she found the
latch, and raised it.&nbsp; The door creaked, as she pulled it open,
and she stood arrested; but the sound went no farther, for the roofed
gallery outside, which looked by two windows on the courtyard, was full
of outdoor noises, the rushing of rain and the running of spouts and
eaves.&nbsp; One of the windows stood wide, admitting the rain and wind,
and as she paused, holding the door open, the draught blew the cloak
from her.&nbsp; She stepped out quickly and shut the door behind her.&nbsp;
On her left was the blind end of the passage; she turned to the right.&nbsp;
She took one step into the darkness and stood motionless.&nbsp; Beside
her, within a few feet of her, some one had moved, with a dull sound
as of a boot on wood; a sound so near her that she held her breath,
and pressed herself against the wall.</p>
<p>She listened.&nbsp; Perhaps some of the servants&mdash;it was a common
usage&mdash;had made their beds on the floor.&nbsp; Perhaps one of the
women had stirred in the room against the wall of which she crouched.&nbsp;
Perhaps&mdash;but, even while she reassured herself, the sound rose
anew at her feet.</p>
<p>Fortunately at the same instant the glare of the lightning flooded
all, and showed the passage, and showed it empty.&nbsp; It lit up the
row of doors on her right and the small windows on her left, and discovered
facing her the door which shut off the rest of the house.&nbsp; She
could have thanked&mdash;nay, she did thank God for that light.&nbsp;
If the sound she had heard recurred she did not hear it; for, as the
thunder which followed hard on the flash crashed overhead and rolled
heavily eastwards, she felt her way boldly along the passage, touching
first one door, and then a second, and then a third.</p>
<p>She groped for the latch of the last, and found it, but, with her
hand on it, paused.&nbsp; In order to summon up her courage, she strove
to hear again the cries of misery and to see again the haggard eyes
which had driven her hither.&nbsp; And if she did not wholly succeed,
other reflections came to her aid.&nbsp; This storm, which covered all
smaller noises, and opened, now and again, God&rsquo;s lantern for her
use, did it not prove that He was on her side, and that she might count
on His protection?&nbsp; The thought at least was timely, and with a
better heart she gathered her wits.&nbsp; Waiting until the thunder
burst over her head, she opened the door, slid within it, and closed
it.&nbsp; She would fain have left it ajar, that in case of need she
might escape the more easily.&nbsp; But the wind, which beat into the
passage through the open window, rendered the precaution too perilous.</p>
<p>She went forward two paces into the room, and as the roll of the
thunder died away she stooped forward and listened with painful intensity
for the sound of Count Hannibal&rsquo;s breathing.&nbsp; But the window
was open, and the hiss of the rain persisted; she could hear nothing
through it, and fearfully she took another step forward.&nbsp; The window
should be before her; the bed in the corner to the left.&nbsp; But nothing
of either could she make out.&nbsp; She must wait for the lightning.</p>
<p>It came, and for a second or more the room shone.&nbsp; The window,
the low truckle-bed, the sleeper, she saw all with dazzling clearness,
and before the flash had well passed she was crouching low, with the
hood of her cloak dragged about her face.&nbsp; For the glare had revealed
Count Hannibal; but not asleep!&nbsp; He lay on his side, his face towards
her; lay with open eyes, staring at her.</p>
<p>Or had the light tricked her?&nbsp; The light must have tricked her,
for in the interval between the flash and the thunder, while she crouched
quaking, he did not move or call.&nbsp; The light must have deceived
her.&nbsp; She felt so certain of it that she found courage to remain
where she was until another flash came and showed him sleeping with
closed eyes.</p>
<p>She drew a breath of relief at that, and rose slowly to her feet.&nbsp;
But she dared not go forward until a third flash had confirmed the second.&nbsp;
Then, while the thunder burst overhead and rolled away, she crept on
until she stood beside the pillow, and, stooping, could hear the sleeper&rsquo;s
breathing.</p>
<p>Alas! the worst remained to be done.&nbsp; The packet, she was sure
of it, lay under his pillow.&nbsp; How was she to find it, how remove
it without rousing him?&nbsp; A touch might awaken him.&nbsp; And yet,
if she would not return empty-handed, if she would not go back to the
harrowing thoughts which had tortured her through the long hours of
the day, it must be done, and done now.</p>
<p>She knew this, yet she hung irresolute a while, blenching before
the manual act, listening to the persistent rush and downpour of the
rain.&nbsp; Then a second time she drew courage from the storm.&nbsp;
How timely had it broken.&nbsp; How signally had it aided her!&nbsp;
How slight had been her chance without it!&nbsp; And so at last, resolutely
but with a deft touch, she slid her fingers between the pillow and the
bed, slightly pressing down the latter with her other hand.&nbsp; For
an instant she fancied that the sleeper&rsquo;s breathing stopped, and
her heart gave a great bound.&nbsp; But the breathing went on the next
instant&mdash;if it had stopped&mdash;and dreading the return of the
lightning, shrinking from being revealed so near him, and in that act&mdash;for
which the darkness seemed more fitting&mdash;she groped farther, and
touched something.&nbsp; Then, as her fingers closed upon it and grasped
it, and his breath rose hot to her burning cheek, she knew that the
real danger lay in the withdrawal.</p>
<p>At the first attempt he uttered a kind of grunt and moved, throwing
out his hand.&nbsp; She thought that he was going to awake, and had
hard work to keep herself where she was; but he did not move, and she
began again with so infinite a precaution that the perspiration ran
down her face and her hair within the hood hung dank on her neck.&nbsp;
Slowly, oh so slowly, she drew back the hand, and with it the packet;
so slowly, and yet so resolutely, being put to it, that when the dreaded
flash surprised her, and she saw his harsh swarthy face, steeped in
the mysterious aloofness of sleep, within a hand&rsquo;s breadth of
hers, not a muscle of her arm moved, nor did her hand quiver.</p>
<p>It was done&mdash;at last!&nbsp; With a burst of gratitude, of triumph,
of exultation, she stood erect.&nbsp; She realized that it was done,
and that here in her hand she held the packet.&nbsp; A deep gasp of
relief, of joy, of thankfulness, and she glided towards the door.</p>
<p>She groped for the latch, and in the act fancied his breathing was
changed.&nbsp; She paused, and bent her head to listen.&nbsp; But the
patter of the rain, drowning all sounds save those of the nearest origin,
persuaded her that she was mistaken, and, finding the latch, she raised
it, slipped like a shadow into the passage, and closed the door behind
her.</p>
<p>That done she stood arrested, all the blood in her body running to
her heart.&nbsp; She must be dreaming!&nbsp; The passage in which she
stood&mdash;the passage which she had left in black darkness&mdash;was
alight; was so far lighted, at least, that to eyes fresh from the night,
the figures of three men, grouped at the farther end, stood out against
the glow of the lanthorn which they appeared to be trimming&mdash;for
the two nearest were stooping over it.&nbsp; These two had their backs
to her, the third his face; and it was the sight of this third man which
had driven the blood to her heart.&nbsp; He ended at the waist!&nbsp;
It was only after a few seconds, it was only when she had gazed at him
awhile in speechless horror, that he rose another foot from the floor,
and she saw that he had paused in the act of ascending through a trapdoor.&nbsp;
What the scene meant, who these men were, or what their entrance portended,
with these questions her brain refused at the moment to grapple.&nbsp;
It was much that&mdash;still remembering who might hear her, and what
she held&mdash;she did not shriek aloud.</p>
<p>Instead, she stood in the gloom at her end of the passage, gazing
with all her eyes until she had seen the third man step clear of the
trap.&nbsp; She could see him; but the light intervened and blurred
his view of her.&nbsp; He stooped, almost as soon as he had cleared
himself, to help up a fourth man, who rose with a naked knife between
his teeth.&nbsp; She saw then that all were armed, and something stealthy
in their bearing, something cruel in their eyes as the light of the
lanthorn fell now on one dark face and now on another, went to her heart
and chilled it.&nbsp; Who were they, and why were they here?&nbsp; What
was their purpose?&nbsp; As her reason awoke, as she asked herself these
questions, the fourth man stooped in his turn, and gave his hand to
a fifth.&nbsp; And on that she lost her self-control, and cried out.&nbsp;
For the last man to ascend was La Tribe&mdash;La Tribe, from whom she
had parted that morning.</p>
<p>The sound she uttered was low, but it reached the men&rsquo;s ears,
and the two whose backs were towards her turned as if they had been
pricked.&nbsp; He who held the lanthorn raised it, and the five glared
at her and she at them.&nbsp; Then a second cry, louder and more full
of surprise, burst from her lips.&nbsp; The nearest man, he who held
the lanthorn high that he might view her, was Tignonville, was her lover!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
it?&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, not till then, did he know her.&nbsp; Until then the light
of the lanthorn had revealed only a cloaked and cowled figure, a gloomy
phantom which shook the heart of more than one with superstitious terror.&nbsp;
But they knew her now&mdash;two of them; and slowly, as in a dream,
Tignonville came forward.</p>
<p>The mind has its moments of crisis, in which it acts upon instinct
rather than upon reason.&nbsp; The girl never knew why she acted as
she did; why she asked no questions, why she uttered no exclamations,
no remonstrances; why, with a finger on her lips and her eyes on his,
she put the packet into his hands.</p>
<p>He took it from her, too, as mechanically as she gave it&mdash;with
the hand which held his bare blade.&nbsp; That done, silent as she,
with his eyes set hard, he would have gone by her.&nbsp; The sight of
her <i>there</i>, guarding the door of him who had stolen her from him,
exasperated his worst passions.&nbsp; But she moved to hinder him, and
barred the way.&nbsp; With her hand raised she pointed to the trapdoor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she whispered, her tone stern and low, &ldquo;you
have what you want!&nbsp; Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he tried to pass her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she repeated in the same tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have what you need.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still she held her hand extended;
still without faltering she faced the five men, while the thunder, growing
more distant, rolled sullenly eastward, and the midnight rain, pouring
from every spout and dripping eave about the house, wrapped the passage
in its sibilant hush.&nbsp; Gradually her eyes dominated his, gradually
her nobler nature and nobler aim subdued his weaker parts.&nbsp; For
she understood now; and he saw that she did, and had he been alone he
would have slunk away, and said no word in his defence.</p>
<p>But one of the men, savage and out of patience, thrust himself between
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the
use of this?&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo;&nbsp; And his bloodshot eyes&mdash;it
was Tuez-les-Moines&mdash;questioned the doors, while his hand, trembling
and shaking on the haft of his knife, bespoke his eagerness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
is he?&nbsp; Where is he, woman?&nbsp; Quick, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not tell you,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; he cried, grinning like a dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
will tell us!&nbsp; Or we will kill you too!&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp;
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not tell you,&rdquo; she repeated, standing before
him in the fearlessness of scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Another step and I rouse
the house!&nbsp; M. de Tignonville, to you who know me, I swear that
if this man does not retire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in one of these rooms?&rdquo; was Tignonville&rsquo;s
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;In which?&nbsp; In which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search them!&rdquo; she answered, her voice low, but biting
in its contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Try them.&nbsp; Rouse my women, alarm
the house!&nbsp; And when you have his people at your throats&mdash;five
as they will be to one of you&mdash;thank your own mad folly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tuez-les-Moines&rsquo; eyes glittered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not
tell us?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as the fanatic sprang on her, La Tribe flung his arms round him
and dragged him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be madness,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
mad, fool?&nbsp; Have done!&rdquo; he panted, struggling with him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If Madame gives the alarm&mdash;and he may be in any one of these
four rooms, you cannot be sure which&mdash;we are undone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He looked for support to Tignonville, whose movement to protect the
girl he had anticipated, and who had since listened sullenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have obtained what we need.&nbsp; Will you requite Madame,
who has gained it for us at her own risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Monsieur I would requite,&rdquo; Tignonville muttered
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By using violence to her?&rdquo; the minister retorted passionately.&nbsp;
He and Tuez were still gripping one another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you,
to go on is to risk what we have got!&nbsp; And I for one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am chicken-hearted!&rdquo; the young man sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
He seemed to choke on the word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you swear that he
is not here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear that if you do not go I will raise the alarm!&rdquo;
she hissed&mdash;all their words were sunk to that stealthy note.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go! if you have not stayed too long already.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp;
Or see!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she pointed to the trapdoor, from which the
face and arms of a sixth man had that moment risen&mdash;the face dark
with perturbation, so that her woman&rsquo;s wit told her at once that
something was amiss.&nbsp; &ldquo;See what has come of your delay already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is rising,&rdquo; the man muttered earnestly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name come, whether you have done it or not, or
we cannot pass out again.&nbsp; It is within a foot of the crown of
the culvert now, and it is rising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse on the water!&rdquo; Tuez-les-Moines answered in a frenzied
whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;And on this Jezebel.&nbsp; Let us kill her and
him!&nbsp; What matter afterwards?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he tried to shake
off La Tribe&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>But the minister held him desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you mad?&nbsp;
Are you mad?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What can we do against
thirty?&nbsp; Let us be gone while we can.&nbsp; Let us be gone!&nbsp;
Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, come,&rdquo; Perrot cried, assenting reluctantly.&nbsp;
He had taken no side hitherto.&nbsp; &ldquo;The luck is against us!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis no use to-night, man!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned with an
air of sullen resignation.&nbsp; Letting his legs drop through the trap,
he followed the bearer of the tidings out of sight.&nbsp; Another made
up his mind to go, and went.&nbsp; Then only Tignonville, holding the
lanthorn, and La Tribe, who feared to release Tuez-les-Moines, remained
with the fanatic.</p>
<p>The Countess&rsquo;s eyes met her old lover&rsquo;s, and whether
old memories overcame her, or, now that the danger was nearly past,
she began to give way, she swayed a little on her feet.&nbsp; But he
did not notice it.&nbsp; He was sunk in black rage&mdash;rage against
her, rage against himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the light,&rdquo; she muttered unsteadily.&nbsp; &ldquo;And&mdash;and
he must follow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she could bear it no longer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, go,&rdquo; she
wailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go!&nbsp; Will you never go?&nbsp; If you love
me, if you ever loved me, I implore you to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had betrayed little of a lover&rsquo;s feeling.&nbsp; But he could
not resist that appeal, and he turned silently.&nbsp; Seizing Tuez-les-Moines
by the other arm, he drew him by force to the trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, fool,&rdquo; he muttered savagely when the man would
have resisted, &ldquo;and go down!&nbsp; If we stay to kill him, we
shall have no way of escape, and his life will be dearly bought.&nbsp;
Down, man, down!&rdquo;&nbsp; And between them, in a struggling silence,
with now and then an audible rap, or a ring of metal, the two forced
the desperado to descend.</p>
<p>La Tribe followed hastily.&nbsp; Tignonville was the last to go.&nbsp;
In the act of disappearing he raised his lanthorn for a last glimpse
of the Countess.&nbsp; To his astonishment the passage was empty; she
was gone.&nbsp; Hard by him a door stood an inch or two ajar, and he
guessed that it was hers, and swore under his breath, hating her at
that moment.&nbsp; But he did not guess how nicely she had calculated
her strength; how nearly exhaustion had overcome her; or that, even
while he paused&mdash;a fatal pause had he known it&mdash;eyeing the
dark opening of the door, she lay as one dead, on the bed within.&nbsp;
She had fallen in a swoon, from which she did not recover until the
sun had risen, and marched across one quarter of the heavens.</p>
<p>Nor did he see another thing, or he might have hastened his steps.&nbsp;
Before the yellow light of his lanthorn faded from the ceiling of the
passage, the door of the room farthest from the trap slid open.&nbsp;
A man, whose eyes, until darkness swallowed him, shone strangely in
a face extraordinarily softened, came out on tip-toe.&nbsp; This man
stood awhile, listening.&nbsp; At length, hearing those below utter
a cry of dismay, he awoke to sudden activity.&nbsp; He opened with a
turn of the key the door which stood at his elbow, the door which led
to the other part of the house.&nbsp; He vanished through it.&nbsp;
A second later a sharp whistle pierced the darkness of the courtyard,
and brought a dozen sleepers to their senses and their feet.&nbsp; A
moment, and the courtyard hummed with voices, above which one voice
rang clear and insistent.&nbsp; With a startled cry the inn awoke.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.&nbsp; THE COMPANY OF THE BLEEDING HEART.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; Madame St. Lo asked, sticking her arms akimbo,
&ldquo;why stay in this forsaken place a day and a night, when six hours
in the saddle would set us in Angers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Tavannes replied coldly&mdash;he and his cousin
were walking before the gateway of the inn&mdash;&ldquo;the Countess
is not well, and will be the better, I think, for staying a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She slept soundly enough!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll answer for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never raised her head this morning, though my women were
shrieking &lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; next door, and&mdash;Name of Heaven!&rdquo;
Madame resumed, after breaking off abruptly, and shading her eyes with
her hand, &ldquo;what comes here?&nbsp; Is it a funeral?&nbsp; Or a
pilgrimage?&nbsp; If all the priests about here are as black, no wonder
M. Rabelais fell out with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inn stood without the walls for the convenience of those who
wished to take the road early: a little also, perhaps, because food
and forage were cheaper, and the wine paid no town-dues.&nbsp; Four
great roads met before the house, along the most easterly of which the
sombre company which had caught Madame St. Lo&rsquo;s attention could
be seen approaching.&nbsp; At first Count Hannibal supposed with his
companion that the travellers were conveying to the grave the corpse
of some person of distinction; for the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> consisted
mainly of priests and the like mounted on mules, and clothed for the
most part in black.&nbsp; Black also was the small banner which waved
above them, and bore in place of arms the emblem of the Bleeding Heart.&nbsp;
But a second glance failed to discover either litter or bier; and a
nearer approach showed that the travellers, whether they wore the tonsure
or not, bore weapons of one kind or another.</p>
<p>Suddenly Madame St. Lo clapped her hands, and proclaimed in great
astonishment that she knew them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there is Father Boucher, the Cur&eacute; of St. Benoist!&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and Father Pezelay of St. Magloire.&nbsp; And there
is another I know, though I cannot remember his name!&nbsp; They are
preachers from Paris!&nbsp; That is who they are!&nbsp; But what can
they be doing here?&nbsp; Is it a pilgrimage, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, a pilgrimage of Blood!&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered
between his teeth.&nbsp; And, turning to him to learn what moved him,
she saw the look in his eyes which portended a storm.&nbsp; Before she
could ask a question, however, the gloomy company, which had first appeared
in the distance, moving, an inky blot, through the hot sunshine of the
summer morning, had drawn near, and was almost abreast of them.&nbsp;
Stepping from her side, he raised his hand and arrested the march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is master here?&rdquo; he asked haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the leader,&rdquo; answered a stout pompous Churchman,
whose small malevolent eyes belied the sallow fatuity of his face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I, M. de Tavannes, by your leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, by your leave,&rdquo; Tavannes sneered, &ldquo;are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archdeacon and Vicar of the Bishop of Angers and Prior of
the Lesser Brethren of St. Germain, M. le Comte.&nbsp; Visitor also
of the Diocese of Angers,&rdquo; the dignitary continued, puffing out
his cheeks, &ldquo;and Chaplain to the Lieutenant-Governor of Saumur,
whose unworthy brother I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A handsome glove, and well embroidered!&rdquo; Tavannes retorted
in a tone of disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hand I see yonder!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He pointed to the lean parchment mask of Father Pezelay, who coloured
ever so faintly, but held his peace under the sneer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are bound for Angers?&rdquo; Count Hannibal continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
what purpose, Sir Prior?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Grace the Bishop is absent, and in his absence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to fill his city with strife!&nbsp; I know you!&nbsp;
Not you!&rdquo; he continued, contemptuously turning from the Prior,
and regarding the third of the principal figures of the party.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you!&nbsp; You were the Cur&eacute; who got the mob together
last All Souls&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak the words of Him Who sent me!&rdquo; answered the
third Churchman, whose brooding face and dull curtained eyes gave no
promise of the fits of frenzied eloquence which had made his pulpit
famous in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Kill and Burn are His alphabet!&rdquo; Tavannes retorted,
and heedless of the start of horror which a saying so near blasphemy
excited among the Churchmen, he turned to Father Pezelay.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you!&nbsp; You, too, I know!&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you
know me!&nbsp; And take this from me.&nbsp; Turn, father!&nbsp; Turn!&nbsp;
Or worse than a broken head&mdash;you bear the scar, I see&mdash;will
befall you.&nbsp; These good persons, whom you have moved, unless I
am in error, to take this journey, may not know me; but you do, and
can tell them.&nbsp; If they will to Angers, they must to Angers.&nbsp;
But if I find trouble in Angers when I come, I will hang some one high.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t scowl at me, man!&rdquo;&mdash;in truth, the look of hate
in Father Pezelay&rsquo;s eyes was enough to provoke the exclamation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some one, and it shall not be a bare patch on the crown will
save his windpipe from squeezing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A murmur of indignation broke from the preachers&rsquo; attendants;
one or two made a show of drawing their weapons.&nbsp; But Count Hannibal
paid no heed to them, and had already turned on his heel when Father
Pezelay spurred his mule a pace or two forward.&nbsp; Snatching a heavy
brass cross from one of the acolytes, he raised it aloft, and in the
voice which had often thrilled the heated congregation of St. Magloire,
he called on Tavannes to pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand, my lord!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And take warning!&nbsp;
Stand, reckless and profane, whose face is set hard as a stone, and
his heart as a flint, against High Heaven and Holy Church!&nbsp; Stand
and hear!&nbsp; Behold the word of the Lord is gone out against this
city, even against Angers, for the unbelief thereof!&nbsp; Her place
shall be left unto her desolate, and her children shall be dashed against
the stones!&nbsp; Woe unto you, therefore, if you gainsay it, or fall
short of that which is commanded! You shall perish as Achan, the son
of Charmi, and as Saul!&nbsp; The curse that has gone out against you
shall not tarry, nor your days continue!&nbsp; For the Canaanitish woman
that is in your house, and for the thought that is in your heart, the
place that was yours is given to another!&nbsp; Yea, the sword is even
now drawn that shall pierce your side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more like to split my ears!&rdquo; Count Hannibal
answered sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now mark me!&nbsp; Preach as you
please here.&nbsp; But a word in Angers, and though you be shaven twice
over, I will have you silenced after a fashion which will not please
you!&nbsp; If you value your tongue therefore, father&mdash;Oh, you
shake off the dust, do you?&nbsp; Well, pass on!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis wise,
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And undismayed by the scowling brows, and the cross ostentatiously
lifted to heaven, he gazed after the procession as it moved on under
its swaying banner, now one and now another of the acolytes looking
back and raising his hands to invoke the bolt of Heaven on the blasphemer.&nbsp;
As the <i>cort&eacute;ge</i> passed the huge watering-troughs, and the
open gateway of the inn, the knot of persons congregated there fell
on their knees.&nbsp; In answer the Churchmen raised their banner higher,
and began to sing the <i>Eripe me, Domine</i>! and to its strains, now
vengeful, now despairing, now rising on a wave of menace, they passed
slowly into the distance, slowly towards Angers and the Loire.</p>
<p>Suddenly Madame St. Lo twitched his sleeve.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enough for
me!&rdquo; she cried passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;I go no farther with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No farther!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; She was pale, she shivered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many thanks, my cousin, but we part company here.&nbsp; I do
not go to Angers.&nbsp; I have seen horrors enough.&nbsp; I will take
my people, and go to my aunt by Tours and the east road.&nbsp; For you,
I foresee what will happen.&nbsp; You will perish between the hammer
and the anvil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You play too fine a game,&rdquo; she continued, her face quivering.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give over the girl to her lover, and send away her people with
her.&nbsp; And wash your hands of her and hers.&nbsp; Or you will see
her fall, and fall beside her!&nbsp; Give her to him, I say&mdash;give
her to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife?&rdquo; she echoed, for, fickle, and at all times swept
away by the emotions of the moment, she was in earnest now.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
there a tie,&rdquo; and she pointed after the vanishing procession,
&ldquo;that they cannot unloose?&nbsp; That they will not unloose?&nbsp;
Is there a life which escapes if they doom it?&nbsp; Did the Admiral
escape?&nbsp; Or Rochefoucauld?&nbsp; Or Madame de Luns in old days?&nbsp;
I tell you they go to rouse Angers against you, and I see beforehand
what will happen.&nbsp; She will perish, and you with her.&nbsp; Wife?&nbsp;
A pretty wife, at whose door you took her lover last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at your door!&rdquo; he answered quietly, unmoved by the
gibe.</p>
<p>But she did not heed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I warned you of that!&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you would not believe me.&nbsp; I told you he
was following.&nbsp; And I warn you of this.&nbsp; You are between the
hammer and the anvil, M. le Comte!&nbsp; If Tignonville does not murder
you in your bed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold him in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Holy Church will fall on you and crush you.&nbsp; For
me, I have seen enough and more than enough.&nbsp; I go to Tours by
the east road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>She flung away in disgust with him.&nbsp; She could not understand
a man who played fast and loose at such a time.&nbsp; The game was too
fine for her, its danger too apparent, the gain too small.&nbsp; She
had, too, a woman&rsquo;s dread of the Church, a woman&rsquo;s belief
in the power of the dead hand to punish.&nbsp; And in half an hour her
orders were given.&nbsp; In two hours her people were gathered, and
she departed by the eastward road, three of Tavannes&rsquo; riders reinforcing
her servants for a part of the way.&nbsp; Count Hannibal stood to watch
them start, and noticed Bigot riding by the side of Suzanne&rsquo;s
mule.&nbsp; He smiled; and presently, as he turned away, he did a thing
rare with him&mdash;he laughed outright.</p>
<p>A laugh which reflected a mood rare as itself.&nbsp; Few had seen
Count Hannibal&rsquo;s eye sparkle as it sparkled now; few had seen
him laugh as he laughed, walking to and fro in the sunshine before the
inn.&nbsp; His men watched him, and wondered, and liked it little, for
one or two who had overheard his altercation with the Churchmen had
reported it, and there was shaking of heads over it.&nbsp; The man who
had singed the Pope&rsquo;s beard and chucked cardinals under the chin
was growing old, and the most daring of the others had no mind to fight
with foes whose weapons were not of this world.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal&rsquo;s gaiety, however, was well grounded, had they
known it.&nbsp; He was gay, not because he foresaw peril, and it was
his nature to love peril; not&mdash;in the main, though a little, perhaps&mdash;because
he knew that the woman whose heart he desired to win had that night
stood between him and death; not, though again a little, perhaps, because
she had confirmed his choice by conduct which a small man might have
deprecated, but which a great man loved; but chiefly, because the events
of the night had placed in his grasp two weapons by the aid of which
he looked to recover all the ground he had lost&mdash;lost by his impulsive
departure from the pall of conduct on which he had started.</p>
<p>Those weapons were Tignonville, taken like a rat in a trap by the
rising of the water; and the knowledge that the Countess had stolen
the precious packet from his pillow.&nbsp; The knowledge&mdash;for he
had lain and felt her breath upon his cheek, he had lain and felt her
hand beneath his pillow, he had lain while the impulse to fling his
arms about her had been almost more than he could tame!&nbsp; He had
lain and suffered her to go, to pass out safely as she had passed in.&nbsp;
And then he had received his reward in the knowledge that, if she robbed
him, she robbed him not for herself; and that where it was a question
of his life she did not fear to risk her own.</p>
<p>When he came, indeed, to that point, he trembled.&nbsp; How narrowly
had he been saved from misjudging her!&nbsp; Had he not lain and waited,
had he not possessed himself in patience, he might have thought her
in collusion with the old lover whom he found at her door, and with
those who came to slay him.&nbsp; Either he might have perished unwarned;
or escaping that danger, he might have detected her with Tignonville
and lost for all time the ideal of a noble woman.</p>
<p>He had escaped that peril.&nbsp; More, he had gained the weapons
we have indicated; and the sense of power, in regard to her, almost
intoxicated him.&nbsp; Surely if he wielded those weapons to the best
advantage, if he strained generosity to the uttermost, the citadel of
her heart must yield at last!</p>
<p>He had the defect of his courage and his nature, a tendency to do
things after a flamboyant fashion.&nbsp; He knew that her act would
plunge him in perils which she had not foreseen.&nbsp; If the preachers
roused the Papists of Angers, if he arrived to find men&rsquo;s swords
whetted for the massacre and the men themselves awaiting the signal,
then if he did not give that signal there would be trouble.&nbsp; There
would be trouble of the kind in which the soul of Hannibal de Tavannes
revelled, trouble about the ancient cathedral and under the black walls
of the Angevin castle; trouble amid which the hearts of common men would
be as water.</p>
<p>Then, when things seemed at their worst, he would reveal his knowledge.&nbsp;
Then, when forgiveness must seem impossible, he would forgive.&nbsp;
With the flood of peril which she had unloosed rising round them, he
would say, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; to the man who had aimed at his life; he
would say to her, &ldquo;I know, and I forgive!&rdquo;&nbsp; That, that
only, would fitly crown the policy on which he had decided from the
first, though he had not hoped to conduct it on lines so splendid as
those which now dazzled him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.&nbsp; TEMPER.</h2>
<p>It was his gaiety, that strange unusual gaiety, still continuing,
which on the following day began by perplexing and ended by terrifying
the Countess.&nbsp; She could not doubt that he had missed the packet
on which so much hung and of which he had indicated the importance.&nbsp;
But if he had missed it, why, she asked herself, did he not speak?&nbsp;
Why did he not cry the alarm, search and question and pursue?&nbsp;
Why did he not give her that opening to tell the truth, without which
even her courage failed, her resolution died within her?</p>
<p>Above all, what was the secret of his strange merriment?&nbsp; Of
the snatches of song which broke from him, only to be hushed by her
look of astonishment?&nbsp; Of the parades which his horse, catching
the infection, made under him, as he tossed his riding-cane high in
the air and caught it?</p>
<p>Ay, what?&nbsp; Why, when he had suffered so great a loss, when he
had been robbed of that of which he must give account&mdash;why did
he cast off his melancholy and ride like the youngest?&nbsp; She wondered
what the men thought, and looking, saw them stare, saw that they watched
him stealthily, saw that they laid their heads together.&nbsp; What
were they thinking of it?&nbsp; She could not tell; and slowly a terror,
more insistent than any to which the extremity of violence would have
reduced her, began to grip her heart.</p>
<p>Twenty hours of rest had lifted her from the state of collapse into
which the events of the night had cast her; still her limbs at starting
had shaken under her.&nbsp; But the cool freshness of the early summer
morning, and the sight of the green landscape and the winding Loir,
beside which their road ran, had not failed to revive her spirits; and
if he had shown himself merely gloomy, merely sunk in revengeful thoughts,
or darting hither and thither the glance of suspicion, she felt that
she could have faced him, and on the first opportunity could have told
him the truth.</p>
<p>But his new mood veiled she knew not what.&nbsp; It seemed, if she
comprehended it at all, the herald of some bizarre, some dreadful vengeance,
in harmony with his fierce and mocking spirit.&nbsp; Before it her heart
became as water.&nbsp; Even her colour little by little left her cheeks.&nbsp;
She knew that he had only to look at her now to read the truth; that
it was written in her face, in her shrinking figure, in the eyes which
now guiltily sought and now avoided his.&nbsp; And feeling sure that
he did read it and know it, she fancied that he licked his lips, as
the cat which plays with the mouse; she fancied that he gloated on her
terror and her perplexity.</p>
<p>This, though the day and the road were warrants for all cheerful
thoughts.&nbsp; On one side vineyards clothed the warm red slopes, and
rose in steps from the valley to the white buildings of a convent.&nbsp;
On the other the stream wound through green flats where the black cattle
stood knee-deep in grass, watched by wild-eyed and half-naked youths.&nbsp;
Again the travellers lost sight of the Loir, and crossing a shoulder,
rode through the dim aisles of a beech-forest, through deep rustling
drifts of last year&rsquo;s leaves.&nbsp; And out again and down again
they passed, and turning aside from the gateway, trailed along beneath
the brown machicolated wall of an old town, from the crumbling battlements
of which faces half-sleepy, half-suspicious, watched them as they moved
below through the glare and heat.&nbsp; Down to the river-level again,
where a squalid anchorite, seated at the mouth of a cave dug in the
bank, begged of them, and the bell of a monastery on the farther bank
tolled slumberously the hour of Nones.</p>
<p>And still he said nothing, and she, cowed by his mysterious gaiety,
yet spurning herself for her cowardice, was silent also.&nbsp; He hoped
to arrive at Angers before nightfall.&nbsp; What, she wondered, shivering,
would happen there?&nbsp; What was he planning to do to her?&nbsp; How
would he punish her?&nbsp; Brave as she was, she was a woman, with a
woman&rsquo;s nerves; and fear and anticipation got upon them; and his
silence&mdash;his silence which must mean a thing worse than words!</p>
<p>And then on a sudden, piercing all, a new thought.&nbsp; Was it possible
that he had other letters?&nbsp; If his bearing were consistent with
anything, it was consistent with that.&nbsp; Had he other genuine letters,
or had he duplicate letters, so that he had lost nothing, but instead
had gained the right to rack and torture her, to taunt and despise her?</p>
<p>That thought stung her into sudden self-betrayal.&nbsp; They were
riding along a broad dusty track which bordered a stone causey raised
above the level of winter floods.&nbsp; Impulsively she turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have other letters!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have other letters!&rdquo;&nbsp; And freed for the moment from her terror,
she fixed her eyes on his and strove to read his face.</p>
<p>He looked at her, his mouth grown hard.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
mean, Madame?&rdquo; he asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have other letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the King, for Angers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw that she was going to confess, that she was going to derange
his cherished plan; and unreasonable anger awoke in the man who had
been more than willing to forgive a real injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you explain?&rdquo; he said between his teeth.&nbsp;
And his eyes glittered unpleasantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have other letters,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;besides those
which I stole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you stole?&rdquo;&nbsp; He repeated the words without
passion.&nbsp; Enraged by this unexpected turn, he hardly knew how to
take it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I!&nbsp; I took them
from under your pillow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a minute.&nbsp; Then he laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not do, Madame,&rdquo; he said, his lip curling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are clever, but you do not deceive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deceive you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not believe that I took the letters?&rdquo; she cried
in great amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and for a good reason.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He had hardened his heart now.&nbsp; He had chosen his line, and he
would not spare her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the best of all reasons,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
the person who stole the letters was seized in the act of making his
escape, and is now in my power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person&mdash;who stole the letters?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean M. de Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned white to the lips, and trembling, could with difficulty
sit her horse.&nbsp; With an effort she pulled it up, and he stopped
also.&nbsp; Their attendants were some way ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have the letters?&rdquo; she whispered, her eyes meeting
his.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have the letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have the thief!&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered with
sinister meaning.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I think you knew, Madame,&rdquo; he
continued ironically, &ldquo;a while back before you spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Oh no, no!&rdquo; and she swayed in her saddle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&mdash;what are you&mdash;going to do?&rdquo; she muttered
after a moment&rsquo;s stricken silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magistrates will decide, at Angers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he did not do it!&nbsp; I swear he did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal shook his head coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear, Monsieur, I took the letters!&rdquo; she repeated
piteously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Punish me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her figure, bowed like
an old woman&rsquo;s over the neck of her horse, seemed to crave his
mercy.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not believe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And then, in a tone which chilled
her, &ldquo;If I did believe you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I should
still punish him!&rdquo;&nbsp; She was broken; but he would see if he
could not break her further.&nbsp; He would try if there were no weak
spot in her armour.&nbsp; He would rack her now, since in the end she
must go free.&nbsp; &ldquo;Understand, Madame,&rdquo; he continued in
his harshest tone, &ldquo;I have had enough of your lover.&nbsp; He
has crossed my path too often.&nbsp; You are my wife, I am your husband.&nbsp;
In a day or two there shall be an end of this farce and of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not take them!&rdquo; she wailed, her face sinking
lower on her breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did not take them!&nbsp; Have mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way, Madame, they are gone!&rdquo; Tavannes answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have taken them between you; and as I do not choose that
you should pay, he will pay the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the discovery that Tignonville had fallen into her husband&rsquo;s
hands had not sufficed to crush her, Count Hannibal&rsquo;s tone must
have done so.&nbsp; The shoot of new life which had raised its head
after those dreadful days in Paris, and&mdash;for she was young&mdash;had
supported her under the weight which the peril of Angers had cast on
her shoulders, died, withered under the heel of his brutality.&nbsp;
The pride which had supported her, which had won Tavannes&rsquo; admiration
and exacted his respect, sank, as she sank herself, bowed to her horse&rsquo;s
neck, weeping bitter tears before him.&nbsp; She abandoned herself to
her misery, as she had once abandoned herself in the upper room in Paris.</p>
<p>And he looked at her.&nbsp; He had willed to crush her; he had his
will, and he was not satisfied.&nbsp; He had bowed her so low that his
magnanimity would now have its full effect, would shine as the sun into
a dark world; and yet he was not happy.&nbsp; He could look forward
to the morrow, and say, &ldquo;She will understand me, she will know
me!&rdquo; and, lo, the thought that she wept for her lover stabbed
him, and stabbed him anew; and he thought, &ldquo;Rather would she death
from him, than life from me!&nbsp; Though I give her creation, it will
not alter her!&nbsp; Though I strike the stars with my head, it is he
who fills her world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought spurred him to further cruelty, impelled him to try if,
prostrate as she was, he could not draw a prayer from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask after him?&rdquo; he scoffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
may be before or behind?&nbsp; Or wounded or well?&nbsp; Would you not
know, Madame?&nbsp; And what message he sent you?&nbsp; And what he
fears, and what hope he has?&nbsp; And his last wishes?&nbsp; And&mdash;for
while there is life there is hope&mdash;would you not learn where the
key of his prison lies to-night?&nbsp; How much for the key to-night,
Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each question fell on her like the lash of a whip; but as one who
has been flogged into insensibility, she did not wince.&nbsp; That drove
him on: he felt a mad desire to hear her prayers, to force her lower,
to bring her to her knees.&nbsp; And he sought about for a keener taunt.&nbsp;
Their attendants were almost out of sight before them; the sun, declining
apace, was in their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two hours we shall be in Angers,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mon Dieu, Madame, it was a pity, when you two were taking letters,
you did not go a step farther.&nbsp; You were surprised, or I doubt
if I should be alive to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she did look up.&nbsp; She raised her head and met his gaze
with such wonder in her eyes, such reproach in her tear-stained face,
that his voice sank on the last word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;that I would have murdered you?&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have cut off my hand first.&nbsp; What I
did&rdquo;&mdash;and now her voice was as firm as it was low&mdash;&ldquo;what
I did, I did to save my people.&nbsp; And if it were to be done again,
I would do it again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare to tell me that to my face?&rdquo; he cried, hiding
feelings which almost choked him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would do it again,
would you?&nbsp; Mon Dieu, Madame, you need to be taught a lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by chance, meaning only to make the horses move on again, he
raised his whip.&nbsp; She thought that he was going to strike her,
and she flinched at last.&nbsp; The whip fell smartly on her horse&rsquo;s
quarters, and it sprang forward.&nbsp; Count Hannibal swore between
his teeth.</p>
<p>He had turned pale, she red as fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get on!&nbsp; Get
on!&rdquo; he cried harshly.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are falling behind!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And riding at her heels, flipping her horse now and then, he forced
her to trot on until they overtook the servants.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.&nbsp; THE BLACK TOWN.</h2>
<p>It was late evening when, riding wearily on jaded horses, they came
to the outskirts of Angers, and saw before them the term of their journey.&nbsp;
The glow of sunset had faded, but the sky was still warm with the last
hues of day; and against its opal light the huge mass of the Angevin
castle, which even in sunshine rises dark and forbidding above the Mayenne,
stood up black and sharply defined.&nbsp; Below it, on both banks of
the river, the towers and spires of the city soared up from a sombre
huddle of ridge-roofs, broken here by a round-headed gateway, crumbling
and pigeon-haunted, that dated from St. Louis, and there by the gaunt
arms of a windmill.</p>
<p>The city lay dark under a light sky, keeping well its secrets.&nbsp;
Thousands were out of doors enjoying the evening coolness in alley and
court, yet it betrayed the life which pulsed in its arteries only by
the low murmur which rose from it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Countess
at sight of its roofs tasted the first moment of happiness which had
been hers that day.&nbsp; She might suffer, but she had saved.&nbsp;
Those roofs would thank her!&nbsp; In that murmur were the voices of
women and children she had redeemed!&nbsp; At the sight and at the thought
a wave of love and tenderness swept all bitterness from her breast.&nbsp;
A profound humility, a boundless thankfulness took possession of her.&nbsp;
Her head sank lower above her horse&rsquo;s mane; but this time it sank
in reverence, not in shame.</p>
<p>Could she have known what was passing beneath those roofs which night
was blending in a common gloom&mdash;could she have read the thoughts
which at that moment paled the cheeks of many a stout burgher, whose
gabled house looked on the great square, she had been still more thankful.&nbsp;
For in attics and back rooms women were on their knees at that hour,
praying with feverish eyes; and in the streets men&mdash;on whom their
fellows, seeing the winding-sheet already at the chin, gazed askance&mdash;smiled,
and showed brave looks abroad, while their hearts were sick with fear.</p>
<p>For darkly, no man knew how, the news had come to Angers.&nbsp; It
had been known, more or less, for three days.&nbsp; Men had read it
in other men&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; The tongue of a scold, the sneer of
an injured woman had spread it, the birds of the air had carried it.&nbsp;
From garret window to garret window across the narrow lanes of the old
town it had been whispered at dead of night; at convent grilles, and
in the timber-yards beside the river.&nbsp; Ten thousand, fifty thousand,
a hundred thousand, it was rumoured, had perished in Paris.&nbsp; In
Orleans, all.&nbsp; In Tours this man&rsquo;s sister; at Saumur that
man&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Through France the word had gone forth that the
Huguenots must die; and in the busy town the same roof-tree sheltered
fear and hate, rage and cupidity.&nbsp; On one side of the party-wall
murder lurked fierce-eyed; on the other, the victim lay watching the
latch, and shaking at a step.&nbsp; Strong men tasted the bitterness
of death, and women clasping their babes to their breasts smiled sickly
into children&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The signal only was lacking.&nbsp; It would come, said some, from
Saumur, where Montsoreau, the Duke of Anjou&rsquo;s Lieutenant-Governor
and a Papist, had his quarters.&nbsp; From Paris, said others, directly
from the King.&nbsp; It might come at any hour now, in the day or in
the night; the magistrates, it was whispered, were in continuous session,
awaiting its coming.&nbsp; No wonder that from lofty gable windows,
and from dormers set high above the tiles, haggard faces looked northward
and eastward, and ears sharpened by fear imagined above the noises of
the city the ring of the iron shoes that carried doom.</p>
<p>Doubtless the majority desired&mdash;as the majority in France have
always desired&mdash;peace.&nbsp; But in the purlieus about the cathedral
and in the lanes where the sacristans lived, in convent parlours and
college courts, among all whose livelihood the new faith threatened,
was a stir as of a hive deranged.&nbsp; Here was grumbling against the
magistrates&mdash;why wait?&nbsp; There, stealthy plannings and arrangements;
everywhere a grinding of weapons and casting of slugs.&nbsp; Old grudges,
new rivalries, a scholar&rsquo;s venom, a priest&rsquo;s dislike, here
was final vent for all.&nbsp; None need leave this feast unsated!</p>
<p>It was a man of this class, sent out for the purpose, who first espied
Count Hannibal&rsquo;s company approaching.&nbsp; He bore the news into
the town, and by the time the travellers reached the city gate, the
dusky street within, on which lights were beginning to twinkle from
booths and casements, was alive with figures running to meet them and
crying the news as they ran.&nbsp; The travellers, weary and road-stained,
had no sooner passed under the arch than they found themselves the core
of a great crowd which moved with them and pressed about them; now unbonneting,
and now calling out questions, and now shouting, &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&nbsp;
Vive le Roi!&rdquo;&nbsp; Above the press, windows burst into light;
and over all, the quaint leaning gables of the old timbered houses looked
down on the hurry and tumult.</p>
<p>They passed along a narrow street in which the rabble, hurrying at
Count Hannibal&rsquo;s bridle, and often looking back to read his face,
had much ado to escape harm; along this street and before the yawning
doors of a great church whence a breath heavy with incense and burning
wax issued to meet them.&nbsp; A portion of the congregation had heard
the tumult and struggled out, and now stood close-packed on the steps
under the double vault of the portal.&nbsp; Among them the Countess&rsquo;s
eyes, as she rode by, a sturdy man-at-arms on either hand, caught and
held one face.&nbsp; It was the face of a tall, lean man in dusty black;
and though she did not know him she seemed to have an equal attraction
for him; for as their eyes met he seized the shoulder of the man next
him and pointed her out.&nbsp; And something in the energy of the gesture,
or in the thin lips and malevolent eyes of the man who pointed, chilled
the Countess&rsquo;s blood and shook her, she knew not why.</p>
<p>Until then, she had known no fear save of her husband.&nbsp; But
at that a sense of the force and pressure of the crowd&mdash;as well
as of the fierce passions, straining about her, which a word might unloose&mdash;broke
upon her; and looking to the stern men on either side she fancied that
she read anxiety in their faces.</p>
<p>She glanced behind.&nbsp; Boot to boot, the Count&rsquo;s men came
on, pressing round her women and shielding them from the exuberance
of the throng.&nbsp; In their faces too she thought that she traced
uneasiness.&nbsp; What wonder if the scenes through which she had passed
in Paris began to recur to her mind, and shook nerves already overwrought?</p>
<p>She began to tremble.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there&mdash;danger?&rdquo;
she muttered, speaking in a low voice to Bigot, who rode on her right
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will they do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Norman snorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not while he is in the saddle,&rdquo;
he said, nodding towards his master, who rode a pace in front of them,
his reins loose.&nbsp; &ldquo;There be some here know him!&rdquo; Bigot
continued, in his drawling tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;And more will know him
if they break line.&nbsp; Have no fear, Madame, he will bring you safe
to the inn.&nbsp; Down with the Huguenots?&rdquo; he continued, turning
from her and addressing a rogue who, holding his stirrup, was shouting
the cry till he was crimson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why not away, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King!&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s word and leave!&rdquo; the
man answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, tell us!&rdquo; shrieked another, looking upward, while
he waved his cap; &ldquo;have we the King&rsquo;s leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bide <i>his</i> leave!&rdquo; the Norman retorted,
indicating the Count with his thumb.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or &rsquo;twill be
up with you&mdash;on the three-legged horse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he comes from the King!&rdquo; the man panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure.&nbsp; To be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bide his time!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
Bigot answered, rather it seemed for his own satisfaction than the other&rsquo;s
enlightenment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll all bide it, you dogs!&rdquo;
he continued in his beard, as he cast his eye over the weltering crowd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ha! so we are here, are we?&nbsp; And not too soon, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell silent as they entered an open space, overlooked on one side
by the dark fa&ccedil;ade of the cathedral, on the other three sides
by houses more or less illumined.&nbsp; The rabble swept into this open
space with them and before them, filled much of it in an instant, and
for a while eddied and swirled this way and that, thrust onward by the
worshippers who had issued from the church and backwards by those who
had been first in the square, and had no mind to be hustled out of hearing.&nbsp;
A stranger, confused by the sea of excited faces, and deafened by the
clamour of &ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo; &ldquo;Vive Anjou!&rdquo; mingled
with cries against the Huguenots, might have fancied that the whole
city was arrayed before him.&nbsp; But he would have been wide of the
mark.&nbsp; The scum, indeed&mdash;and a dangerous scum&mdash;frothed
and foamed and spat under Tavannes&rsquo; bridle-hand; and here and
there among them, but not of them, the dark-robed figure of a priest
moved to and fro; or a Benedictine, or some smooth-faced acolyte egged
on to the work he dared not do.&nbsp; But the decent burghers were not
there.&nbsp; They lay bolted in their houses; while the magistrates,
with little heart to do aught except bow to the mob&mdash;or other their
masters for the time being&mdash;shook in their council chamber.</p>
<p>There is not a city of France which has not seen it; which has not
known the moment when the mass impended, and it lay with one man to
start it or stay its course.&nbsp; Angers within its houses heard the
clamour, and from the child, clinging to its mother&rsquo;s skirt, and
wondering why she wept, to the Provost, trembled, believing that the
hour had come.&nbsp; The Countess heard it too, and understood it.&nbsp;
She caught the savage note in the voice of the mob&mdash;that note which
means danger&mdash;and, her heart beating wildly, she looked to her
husband.&nbsp; Then, fortunately for her, fortunately for Angers, it
was given to all to see that in Count Hannibal&rsquo;s saddle sat a
man.</p>
<p>He raised his hand for silence, and in a minute or two&mdash;not
at once, for the square was dusky&mdash;it was obtained.&nbsp; He rose
in his stirrups, and bared his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am from the King!&rdquo; he cried, throwing his voice to
all parts of the crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this is his Majesty&rsquo;s
pleasure and good will!&nbsp; That every man hold his hand until to-morrow
on pain of death, or worse!&nbsp; And at noon his further pleasure will
be known!&nbsp; Vive le Roi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he covered his head again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vive le Roi!&rdquo; cried a number of the foremost.&nbsp;
But their shouts were feeble and half-hearted, and were quickly drowned
in a rising murmur of discontent and ill-humour, which, mingled with
cries of &ldquo;Is that all?&nbsp; Is there no more?&nbsp; Down with
the Huguenots!&rdquo; rose from all parts.&nbsp; Presently these cries
became merged in a persistent call, which had its origin, as far as
could be discovered, in the darkest corner of the square.&nbsp; A call
for &ldquo;Montsoreau!&nbsp; Montsoreau!&nbsp; Give us Montsoreau!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another man, or had Tavannes turned or withdrawn, or betrayed
the least anxiety, words had become actions, disorder a riot; and that
in the twinkling of an eye.&nbsp; But Count Hannibal, sitting his horse,
with his handful of riders behind him, watched the crowd, as little
moved by it as the Armed Knight of Notre Dame.&nbsp; Only once did he
say a word.&nbsp; Then, raising his hand as before to gain a hearing&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask for Montsoreau?&rdquo; he thundered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
will have Montfaucon if you do not quickly go to your homes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which, and at the glare of his eye, the more timid took fright.&nbsp;
Feeling his gaze upon them, seeing that he had no intention of withdrawing,
they began to sneak away by ones and twos.&nbsp; Soon others missed
them and took the alarm, and followed.&nbsp; A moment and scores were
streaming away through lanes and alleys and along the main street.&nbsp;
At last the bolder and more turbulent found themselves a remnant.&nbsp;
They glanced uneasily at one another and at Tavannes, took fright in
their turn, and plunging into the current hastened away, raising now
and then as they passed through the streets a cry of &ldquo;Vive Montsoreau!&nbsp;
Montsoreau!&rdquo;&mdash;which was not without its menace for the morrow.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal waited motionless until no more than half a dozen
groups remained in the open.&nbsp; Then he gave the word to dismount;
for, so far, even the Countess and her women had kept their saddles,
lest the movement which their retreat into the inn must have caused
should be misread by the mob.&nbsp; Last of all he dismounted himself,
and with lights going before him and behind, and preceded by Bigot,
bearing his cloak and pistols, he escorted the Countess into the house.&nbsp;
Not many minutes had elapsed since he had called for silence; but long
before he reached the chamber looking over the square from the first
floor, in which supper was being set for them, the news had flown through
the length and breadth of Angers that for this night the danger was
past.&nbsp; The hawk had come to Angers, and lo! it was a dove.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal strode to one of the open windows and looked out.&nbsp;
In the room, which was well lighted, were people of the house, going
to and fro, setting out the table; to Madame, standing beside the hearth&mdash;which
held its summer dressing of green boughs&mdash;while her woman held
water for her to wash, the scene recalled with painful vividness the
meal at which she had been present on the morning of the St. Bartholomew&mdash;the
meal which had ushered in her troubles.&nbsp; Naturally her eyes went
to her husband, her mind to the horror in which she had held him then;
and with a kind of shock&mdash;perhaps because the last few minutes
had shown him in a new light&mdash;she compared her old opinion of him
with that which, much as she feared him, she now entertained.</p>
<p>This afternoon, if ever, within the last few hours, if at all, he
had acted in a way to justify that horror and that opinion.&nbsp; He
had treated her&mdash;brutally; he had insulted and threatened her,
had almost struck her.&nbsp; And yet&mdash;and yet Madame felt that
she had moved so far from the point which she had once occupied that
the old attitude was hard to understand.&nbsp; Hardly could she believe
that it was on this man, much as she still dreaded him, that she had
looked with those feelings of repulsion.</p>
<p>She was still gazing at him with eyes which strove to see two men
in one, when he turned from the window.&nbsp; Absorbed in thought, she
had forgotten her occupation, and stood, the towel suspended in her
half-dried hands.&nbsp; Before she knew what he was doing he was at
her side; he bade the woman hold the bowl, and he rinsed his hands.&nbsp;
Then he turned, and without looking at the Countess, he dried his hands
on the farther end of the towel which she was still using.</p>
<p>She blushed faintly.&nbsp; A something in the act, more intimate
and more familiar than had ever marked their intercourse, set her blood
running strangely.&nbsp; When he turned away and bade Bigot unbuckle
his spur-leathers, she stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it!&rdquo; she murmured, acting on a sudden and
unaccountable impulse.&nbsp; And as she knelt, she shook her hair about
her face to hide its colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Madame, but you will soil your fingers!&rdquo; he said
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; she muttered half coherently.&nbsp; And
though her fingers shook, she pursued and performed her task.</p>
<p>When she rose he thanked her; and then the devil in the man, or the
Nemesis he had provoked when he took her by force from another&mdash;the
Nemesis of jealousy, drove him to spoil all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for whose sake, Madame?&rdquo; he added, with a jeer;
&ldquo;mine or M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with a glance
between jest and earnest, he tried to read her thoughts.</p>
<p>She winced as if he had indeed struck her, and the hot colour fled
her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his sake!&rdquo; she said, with a shiver of pain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That his life may be spared!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stood back
humbly, like a beaten dog.&nbsp; Though, indeed, it was for the sake
of Angers, in thankfulness for the past rather than in any desperate
hope of propitiating her husband, that she had done it!</p>
<p>Perhaps he would have withdrawn his words.&nbsp; But before he could
answer, the host, bowing to the floor, came to announce that all was
ready, and that the Provost of the City, for whom M. le Comte had sent,
was in waiting below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him come up!&rdquo; Tavannes answered, grave and frowning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And see you, close the room, sirrah!&nbsp; My people will wait
on us.&nbsp; Ah!&rdquo; as the Provost, a burly man, with a face framed
for jollity, but now pale and long, entered and approached him with
many salutations.&nbsp; &ldquo;How comes it, M. le Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t&mdash;you
are the Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, M. le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it that so great a crowd is permitted to meet in
the streets?&nbsp; And that at my entrance, though I come unannounced,
I find half of the city gathered together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provost stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Respect, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;for His Majesty&rsquo;s letters, of which you are the bearer,
no doubt induced some to come together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I brought letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I brought letters?&rdquo; Count Hannibal repeated
in a strenuous voice.&nbsp; And he ground his chair half about and faced
the astonished magistrate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who said I brought letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my lord,&rdquo; the Provost stammered, &ldquo;it was
everywhere yesterday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, at latest&mdash;that letters were coming from
the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your lordship&rsquo;s hand&mdash;whose name is so well
known here,&rdquo; the magistrate added, in the hope of clearing the
great man&rsquo;s brow.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal laughed darkly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My hand will be better
known by-and-by,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;See you, sirrah, there
is some practice here.&nbsp; What is this cry of Montsoreau that I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lordship knows that he is His Grace&rsquo;s lieutenant-governor
in Saumur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, man.&nbsp; But is he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was at Saumur yesterday, and &rsquo;twas rumoured three
days back that he was coming here to extirpate the Huguenots.&nbsp;
Then word came of your lordship and of His Majesty&rsquo;s letters,
and &rsquo;twas thought that M. de Montsoreau would not come, his authority
being superseded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; And now your rabble think that they would prefer
M. Montsoreau.&nbsp; That is it, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate shrugged his shoulders and opened his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And having spat on the floor,
he looked apologetically at the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;True pigs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What connections has he here?&rdquo; Tavannes asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a brother of my lord the Bishop&rsquo;s vicar, who arrived
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a rout of shaven heads who have been preaching and stirring
up the town!&rdquo; Count Hannibal cried, his face growing red.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak, man; is it so?&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be sworn it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been preaching,&rdquo; the Provost answered reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Montsoreau may count his brother, then, for one.&nbsp; He
is a fool, but with a knave behind him, and a knave who has no cause
to love us!&nbsp; And the Castle?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis held by one of M.
de Montsoreau&rsquo;s creatures, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate shrugged his shoulders, and looked doubtfully at Badelon,
who was keeping the door.&nbsp; Tavannes followed the glance with his
usual impatience.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mon Dieu, you need not look at him!&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has sacked St. Peter&rsquo;s and singed the
Pope&rsquo;s beard with a holy candle!&nbsp; He has been served on the
knee by Cardinals; and is Turk or Jew, or monk or Huguenot as I please.&nbsp;
And Madame&rdquo;&mdash;for the Provost&rsquo;s astonished eyes, after
resting awhile on the old soldier&rsquo;s iron visage, had passed to
her&mdash;&ldquo;is Huguenot, so you need have no fear of her!&nbsp;
There, speak, man,&rdquo; with impatience, &ldquo;and cease to think
of your own skin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provost drew a deep breath, and fixed his small eyes on Count
Hannibal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew, my lord, what you&mdash;why, my own sister&rsquo;s
son&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, his face began to work, his voice shook&mdash;&ldquo;is
a Huguenot!&nbsp; Ay, my lord, a Huguenot!&nbsp; And they know it!&rdquo;
he continued, a flush of rage augmenting the emotion which his countenance
betrayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, they know it!&nbsp; And they push me on at
the Council, and grin behind my back; Lescot, who was Provost two years
back, and would match his son with my daughter; and Thuriot, who prints
for the University!&nbsp; They nudge one another, and egg me on, till
half the city thinks it is I who would kill the Huguenots!&nbsp; I!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Again his voice broke.&nbsp; &ldquo;And my own sister&rsquo;s son a
Huguenot!&nbsp; And my girl at home white-faced for&mdash;for his sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tavannes scanned the man shrewdly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps she is of
the same way of thinking?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Provost started, and lost one half of his colour.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
forbid!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;saving Madame&rsquo;s presence!&nbsp;
Who says so, my lord, lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lies not far from the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish, man, Lescot has said it, and will act on it.&nbsp; And
Thuriot, who prints for the University!&nbsp; Would you &rsquo;scape
them?&nbsp; You would?&nbsp; Then listen to me.&nbsp; I want but two
things.&nbsp; First, how many men has Montsoreau&rsquo;s fellow in the
Castle?&nbsp; Few, I know, for he is a niggard, and if he spends, he
spends the Duke&rsquo;s pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve.&nbsp; But five can hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but twelve dare not leave it!&nbsp; Let them stew in their
own broth!&nbsp; And now for the other matter.&nbsp; See, man, that
before daybreak three gibbets, with a ladder and two ropes apiece, are
set up in the square.&nbsp; And let one be before this door.&nbsp; You
understand?&nbsp; Then let it be done!&nbsp; The rest,&rdquo; he added
with a ferocious smile, &ldquo;you may leave to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate nodded rather feebly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo;
he said, his eye wandering here and there, &ldquo;there are rogues in
Angers.&nbsp; And for rogues the gibbet!&nbsp; But saving your presence,
my lord, it is a question whether&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But M. de Tavannes&rsquo; patience was exhausted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you do it?&rdquo; he roared.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the question.&nbsp;
And the only question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provost jumped, he was so startled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly, my
lord, certainly!&rdquo; he muttered humbly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly,
I will!&rdquo;&nbsp; And bowing frequently, but saying no more, he backed
himself out of the room.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal laughed grimly after his fashion, and doubtless thought
that he had seen the last of the magistrate for that night.&nbsp; Great
was his wrath, therefore, when, less than a minute later&mdash;and before
Bigot had carved for him&mdash;the door opened, and the Provost appeared
again.&nbsp; He slid in, and without giving the courage he had gained
on the stairs time to cool, plunged into his trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands this way, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he bleated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I put up the gibbets and a man is hanged, and you have letters
from the King, &rsquo;tis a rogue the less, and no harm done.&nbsp;
But if you have no letters from His Majesty, then it is on my shoulders
they will put it, and &rsquo;twill be odd if they do not find a way
to hang me to right him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal smiled grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;And your sister&rsquo;s
son?&rdquo; he sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And your girl who is white-faced
for his sake, and may burn on the same bonfire with him?&nbsp; And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&nbsp; Mercy!&rdquo; the wretched Provost cried.&nbsp;
And he wrung his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lescot and Thuriot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may hang Lescot and Thuriot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I see no way out,&rdquo; the Provost babbled.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
way!&nbsp; No way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to show you one,&rdquo; Tavannes retorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the gibbets are not in place by sunrise, I shall hang you
from this window.&nbsp; That is one way out; and you&rsquo;ll be wise
to take the other!&nbsp; For the rest and for your comfort, if I have
no letters, it is not always to paper that the King commits his inmost
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate bowed.&nbsp; He quaked, he doubted, but he had no
choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I put myself in your hands.&nbsp;
It shall be done, certainly it shall be done.&nbsp; But, but&mdash;&rdquo;
and shaking his head in foreboding, he turned to the door.&nbsp; At
the last moment, when he was within a pace of it, the Countess rose
impulsively to her feet.&nbsp; She called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. le Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t, a minute, if you please,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There may be trouble to-morrow; your daughter
may be in some peril.&nbsp; You will do well to send her to me.&nbsp;
My lord&rdquo;&mdash;and on the word her voice, uncertain before, grew
full and steady&mdash;&ldquo;will see that I am safe.&nbsp; And she
will be safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provost saw before him only a gracious lady, moved by a thoughtfulness
unusual in persons of her rank.&nbsp; He was at no pains to explain
the flame in her cheek, or the soft light which glowed in her eyes,
as she looked at him across her formidable husband.&nbsp; He was only
profoundly grateful&mdash;moved even to tears.&nbsp; Humbly thanking
her, he accepted her offer for his child, and withdrew wiping his eyes.&nbsp;
When he was gone, and the door had closed behind him, Tavannes turned
to the Countess, who still kept her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very confident this evening,&rdquo; he sneered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gibbets do not frighten you, it seems, madame.&nbsp; Perhaps
if you knew for whom the one before the door is intended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met his look with a searching gaze, and spoke with a ring of
defiance in her tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not believe it!&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not believe it!&nbsp; You who save Angers will not destroy
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then her woman&rsquo;s mood changing, with courage
and colour ebbing together, &ldquo;Oh no, you will not!&nbsp; You will
not!&rdquo; she wailed.&nbsp; And she dropped on her knees before him,
and holding up her clasped hands, &ldquo;God will put it in your heart
to spare him&mdash;and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose with a stifled oath, took two steps from her, and in a tone
hoarse and constrained, &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go,
or sit!&nbsp; Do you hear, Madame?&nbsp; You try my patience too far!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when she had gone his face was radiant.&nbsp; He had brought
her, he had brought all, to the point at which he aimed.&nbsp; To-morrow
his triumph awaited him.&nbsp; To-morrow he who had cast her down would
raise her up.</p>
<p>He did not foresee what a day would bring forth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.&nbsp; IN THE LITTLE CHAPTER-HOUSE.</h2>
<p>The sun was an hour high, and in Angers the shops and booths, after
the early fashion of the day, were open or opening.&nbsp; Through all
the gates country folk were pressing into the gloomy streets of the
Black Town with milk and fruit; and at doors and windows housewives
cheapened fish, or chaffered over the fowl for the pot.&nbsp; For men
must eat, though there be gibbets in the Place Ste.-Croix: gaunt gibbets,
high and black and twofold, each, with its dangling ropes, like a double
note of interrogation.</p>
<p>But gibbets must eat also; and between ground and noose was so small
a space in those days that a man dangled almost before he knew it.&nbsp;
The sooner, then, the paniers were empty, and the clown, who pays for
all, was beyond the gates, the better he, for one, would be pleased.&nbsp;
In the market, therefore, was hurrying.&nbsp; Men cried their wares
in lowered voices, and tarried but a little for the oldest customer.&nbsp;
The bargain struck, the more timid among the buyers hastened to shut
themselves into their houses again; the bolder, who ventured to the
Place to confirm the rumour with their eyes, talked in corners and in
lanes, avoided the open, and eyed the sinister preparations from afar.&nbsp;
The shadow of the things which stood before the cathedral affronting
the sunlight with their gaunt black shapes lay across the length and
breadth of Angers.&nbsp; Even in the corners where men whispered, even
in the cloisters where men bit their nails in impotent anger, the stillness
of fear ruled all.&nbsp; Whatever Count Hannibal had it in his mind
to tell the city, it seemed unlikely&mdash;and hour by hour it seemed
less likely&mdash;that any would contradict him.</p>
<p>He knew this as he walked in the sunlight before the inn, his spurs
ringing on the stones as he made each turn, his movements watched by
a hundred peering eyes.&nbsp; After all, it was not hard to rule, nor
to have one&rsquo;s way in this world.&nbsp; But then, he went on to
remember, not every one had his self-control, or that contempt for the
weak and unsuccessful which lightly took the form of mercy.&nbsp; He
held Angers safe, curbed by his gibbets.&nbsp; With M. de Montsoreau
he might have trouble; but the trouble would be slight, for he knew
Montsoreau, and what it was the Lieutenant-Governor valued above profitless
bloodshed.</p>
<p>He might have felt less confident had he known what was passing at
that moment in a room off the small cloister of the Abbey of St. Aubin,
a room known at Angers as the Little Chapter-house.&nbsp; It was a long
chamber with a groined roof and stone walls, panelled as high as a tall
man might reach with dark chestnut wood.&nbsp; Gloomily lighted by three
grated windows, which looked on a small inner green, the last resting-place
of the Benedictines, the room itself seemed at first sight no more than
the last resting-place of worn-out odds and ends.&nbsp; Piles of thin
sheepskin folios, dog&rsquo;s-eared and dirty, the rejected of the choir,
stood against the walls; here and there among them lay a large brass-bound
tome on which the chains that had fettered it to desk or lectern still
rusted.&nbsp; A broken altar cumbered one corner: a stand bearing a
curious&mdash;and rotting&mdash;map filled another.&nbsp; In the other
two corners a medley of faded scutcheons and banners, which had seen
their last Toussaint procession, mouldered slowly into dust&mdash;into
much dust.&nbsp; The air of the room was full of it.</p>
<p>In spite of which the long oak table that filled the middle of the
chamber shone with use: so did the great metal standish which it bore.&nbsp;
And though the seven men who sat about the table seemed, at a first
glance and in that gloomy light, as rusty and faded as the rubbish behind
them, it needed but a second look at their lean jaws and hungry eyes
to be sure of their vitality.</p>
<p>He who sat in the great chair at the end of the table was indeed
rather plump than thin.&nbsp; His white hands, gay with rings, were
well cared for; his peevish chin rested on a falling-collar of lace
worthy of a Cardinal.&nbsp; But though the Bishop&rsquo;s Vicar was
heard with deference, it was noticeable that when he had ceased to speak
his hearers looked to the priest on his left, to Father Pezelay, and
waited to hear his opinion before they gave their own.&nbsp; The Father&rsquo;s
energy, indeed, had dominated the Angerins, clerks and townsfolk alike,
as it had dominated the Parisian <i>d&eacute;votes</i> who knew him
well.&nbsp; The vigour which hate inspires passes often for solid strength;
and he who had seen with his own eyes the things done in Paris spoke
with an authority to which the more timid quickly and easily succumbed.</p>
<p>Yet gibbets are ugly things; and Thuriot, the printer, whose pride
had been tickled by a summons to the conclave, began to wonder if he
had done wisely in coming.&nbsp; Lescot, too, who presently ventured
a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if M. de Tavannes&rsquo; order be to do nothing,&rdquo;
he began doubtfully, &ldquo;you would not, reverend Father, have us
resist his Majesty&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid, my friend!&rdquo; Father Pezelay answered with
unction.&nbsp; &ldquo;But his Majesty&rsquo;s will is to do&mdash;to
do for the glory of God and the saints and His Holy Church!&nbsp; How?&nbsp;
Is that which was lawful at Saumur unlawful here?&nbsp; Is that which
was lawful at Tours unlawful here?&nbsp; Is that which the King did
in Paris&mdash;to the utter extermination of the unbelieving and the
purging of that Sacred City&mdash;against his will here?&nbsp; Nay,
his will is to do&mdash;to do as they have done in Paris and in Tours
and in Saumur!&nbsp; But his Minister is unfaithful!&nbsp; The woman
whom he has taken to his bosom has bewildered him with her charms and
her sorceries, and put it in his mind to deny the mission he bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure, beyond chance of error, that he bears letters
to that effect, good Father?&rdquo; the printer ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask my lord&rsquo;s Vicar!&nbsp; He knows the letters and
the import of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are to that effect,&rdquo; the Archdeacon answered, drumming
on the table with his fingers and speaking somewhat sullenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was in the Chancellery, and I saw them.&nbsp; They are duplicates
of those sent to Bordeaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the preparations he has made must be against the Huguenots,&rdquo;
Lescot, the ex-Provost, said with a sigh of relief.&nbsp; And Thuriot&rsquo;s
face lightened also.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must intend to hang one or two
of the ringleaders, before he deals with the herd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it not!&rdquo; Father Pezelay cried in his high shrill
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you the woman has bewitched him, and he will
deny his letters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;But dare he do
that, reverend Father?&rdquo; Lescot asked slowly and incredulously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What?&nbsp; Suppress the King&rsquo;s letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing he will not dare!&nbsp; There is nothing
he has not dared!&rdquo; the priest answered vehemently, the recollection
of the scene in the great guard-room of the Louvre, when Tavannes had
so skilfully turned the tables on him, instilling venom into his tone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She who lives with him is the devil&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She has bewitched
him with her spells and her Sabbaths!&nbsp; She bears the mark of the
Beast on her bosom, and for her the fire is even now kindling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laymen who were present shuddered.&nbsp; The two canons who faced
them crossed themselves, muttering, &ldquo;Avaunt, Satan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for you to decide,&rdquo; the priest continued, gazing
on them passionately, &ldquo;whether you will side with him or with
the Angel of God!&nbsp; For I tell you it was none other executed the
Divine judgments at Paris!&nbsp; It was none other but the Angel of
God held the sword at Tours!&nbsp; It is none other holds the sword
here!&nbsp; Are you for him or against him?&nbsp; Are you for him, or
for the woman with the mark of the Beast?&nbsp; Are you for God or against
God?&nbsp; For the hour draws near!&nbsp; The time is at hand!&nbsp;
You must choose!&nbsp; You must choose!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, striking the
table with his hand, he leaned forward, and with glittering eyes fixed
each of them in turn, as he cried, &ldquo;You must choose!&nbsp; You
must choose!&rdquo;&nbsp; He came to the Archdeacon last.</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s Vicar fidgeted in his chair, his face a shade
more shallow, his cheeks hanging a trifle more loosely, than ordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my brother were here!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
M. de Montsoreau had arrived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Father Pezelay knew whose will would prevail if Montsoreau met
Tavannes at his leisure.&nbsp; To force Montsoreau&rsquo;s hand, therefore,
to surround him on his first entrance with a howling mob already committed
to violence, to set him at their head and pledge him before he knew
with whom he had to do&mdash;this had been, this still was, the priest&rsquo;s
design.</p>
<p>But how was he to pursue it while those gibbets stood?&nbsp; While
their shadows lay even on the chapter table, and darkened the faces
of his most forward associates?&nbsp; That for a moment staggered the
priest; and had not private hatred, ever renewed by the touch of the
scar on his brow, fed the fire of bigotry he had yielded, as the rabble
of Angers were yielding, reluctant and scowling, to the hand which held
the city in its grip.&nbsp; But to have come so far on the wings of
hate, and to do nothing!&nbsp; To have come avowedly to preach a crusade,
and to sneak away cowed!&nbsp; To have dragged the Bishop&rsquo;s Vicar
hither, and fawned and cajoled and threatened by turns&mdash;and for
nothing!&nbsp; These things were passing bitter&mdash;passing bitter,
when the morsel of vengeance he had foreseen smacked so sweet on the
tongue.</p>
<p>For it was no common vengeance, no layman&rsquo;s vengeance, coarse
and clumsy, which the priest had imagined in the dark hours of the night,
when his feverish brain kept him wakeful.&nbsp; To see Count Hannibal
roll in the dust had gone but a little way towards satisfying him.&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; But to drag from his arms the woman for whom he had sinned,
to subject her to shame and torture in the depths of some convent, and
finally to burn her as a witch&mdash;it was that which had seemed to
the priest in the night hours a vengeance sweet in the mouth.</p>
<p>But the thing seemed unattainable in the circumstances.&nbsp; The
city was cowed; the priest knew that no dependence was to be placed
on Montsoreau, whose vice was avarice and whose object was plunder.&nbsp;
To the Archdeacon&rsquo;s feeble words, therefore, &ldquo;We must look,&rdquo;
the priest retorted sternly, &ldquo;not to M. de Montsoreau, reverend
Father, but to the pious of Angers!&nbsp; We must cry in the streets,
&lsquo;They do violence to God!&nbsp; They wound God and His Mother!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And so, and so only, shall the unholy thing be rooted out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; the Cur&eacute; of St.-Benoist muttered, lifting
his head; and his dull eyes glowed awhile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Amen!&nbsp;
Amen!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then his chin sank again upon his breast.</p>
<p>But the Canons of Angers looked doubtfully at one another, and timidly
at the speakers; the meat was too strong for them.&nbsp; And Lescot
and Thuriot shuffled in their seats.&nbsp; At length, &ldquo;I do not
know,&rdquo; Lescot muttered timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people will know!&rdquo; Father Pezelay retorted &ldquo;Trust
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the people will not rise without a leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will I lead them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, reverend Father&mdash;I doubt,&rdquo; Lescot faltered.&nbsp;
And Thuriot nodded assent.&nbsp; Gibbets were erected in those days
rather for laymen than for the Church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubt!&rdquo; the priest cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You doubt!&rdquo;&nbsp;
His baleful eyes passed from one to the other; from them to the rest
of the company.&nbsp; He saw that with the exception of the Cur&eacute;
of St.-Benoist all were of a mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;You doubt!&nbsp; Nay,
but I see what it is!&nbsp; It is this,&rdquo; he continued slowly and
in a different tone, &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s will goes for nothing in
Angers!&nbsp; His writ runs not here.&nbsp; And Holy Church cries in
vain for help against the oppressor.&nbsp; I tell you, the sorceress
who has bewitched him has bewitched you also.&nbsp; Beware! beware,
therefore, lest it be with you as with him!&nbsp; And the fire that
shall consume her, spare not your houses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two citizens crossed themselves, grew pale and shuddered.&nbsp;
The fear of witchcraft was great in Angers, the peril, if accused of
it, enormous.&nbsp; Even the Canons looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if my brother were here,&rdquo; the Archdeacon repeated
feebly, &ldquo;something might be done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vain is the help of man!&rdquo; the priest retorted sternly,
and with a gesture of sublime dismissal.&nbsp; &ldquo;I turn from you
to a mightier than you!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, leaning his head on his hands,
he covered his face.</p>
<p>The Archdeacon and the churchmen looked at him, and from him their
scared eyes passed to one another.&nbsp; Their one desire now was to
be quit of the matter, to have done with it, to escape; and one by one
with the air of whipped curs they rose to their feet, and in a hurry
to be gone muttered a word of excuse shamefacedly and got themselves
out of the room.&nbsp; Lescot and the printer were not slow to follow,
and in less than a minute the two strange preachers, the men from Paris,
remained the only occupants of the chamber; save, to be precise, a lean
official in rusty black, who throughout the conference had sat by the
door.</p>
<p>Until the last shuffling footstep had ceased to sound in the still
cloister no one spoke.&nbsp; Then Father Pezelay looked up, and the
eyes of the two priests met in a long gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you?&rdquo; Pezelay muttered at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wet hay,&rdquo; the other answered dreamily, &ldquo;is slow
to kindle, yet burns if the fire be big enough.&nbsp; At what hour does
he state his will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Council Chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so given out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is three hundred yards from the Place Ste.-Croix and he
must go guarded,&rdquo; the Cur&eacute; of St.-Benoist continued in
the same dull fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cannot leave many in the house
with the woman.&nbsp; If it were attacked in his absence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would return, and&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Father Pezelay shook
his head, his cheek turned a shade paler.&nbsp; Clearly, he saw with
his mind&rsquo;s eye more than he expressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hoc est corpus</i>,&rdquo; the other muttered, his dreamy
gaze on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he met us then, on his way to the
house and we had bell, book, and candle, would he stop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not stop!&rdquo; Father Pezelay rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; but the rest St. Benoist whispered, his
head drooping forward; whispered so low that even the lean man behind
him, listening with greedy ears, failed to follow the meaning of his
superior&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; But that he spoke plainly enough for his
hearer Father Pezelay&rsquo;s face was witness.&nbsp; Astonishment,
fear, hope, triumph, the lean pale face reflected all in turn; and,
underlying all, a subtle malignant mischief, as if a devil&rsquo;s eyes
peeped through the holes in an opera mask.</p>
<p>When the other was at last silent, Pezelay drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis bold!&nbsp; Bold!&nbsp; Bold!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But have you thought?&nbsp; He who bears the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brunt?&rdquo; the other whispered, with a chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
may suffer?&nbsp; Yes, but it will not be you or I!&nbsp; No, he who
was last here shall be first there!&nbsp; The Archdeacon-Vicar&mdash;if
we can persuade him&mdash;who knows but that even for him the crown
of martyrdom is reserved?&rdquo;&nbsp; The dull eyes flickered with
unholy amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the alarm that brings him from the Council Chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need not of necessity be real.&nbsp; The pinch will be to
make use of it.&nbsp; Make use of it&mdash;and the hay will burn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can one man do against a thousand?&nbsp; His own people
dare not support him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Pezelay turned to the lean man who kept the door, and, beckoning
to him, conferred a while with him in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A score or so I might get,&rdquo; the man answered presently,
after some debate.&nbsp; &ldquo;And well posted, something might be
done.&nbsp; But we are not in Paris, good father, where the Quarter
of the Butchers is to be counted on, and men know that to kill Huguenots
is to do God service!&nbsp; Here&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders
contemptuously&mdash;&ldquo;they are sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the King&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; the priest answered, frowning
on him darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but it is not Tavannes&rsquo;,&rdquo; the man in black
answered with a grimace.&nbsp; &ldquo;And he rules here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Pezelay retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has not twenty
with him.&nbsp; Do you do as I say, and leave the rest to Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to you, good master?&rdquo; the other answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For it is not all you are going to do,&rdquo; he continued, with
a grin, &ldquo;that you have told me.&nbsp; Well, so be it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
do my part, but I wish we were in Paris.&nbsp; St. Genevieve is ever
kind to her servants.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.&nbsp; THE ESCAPE.</h2>
<p>In a small back room on the second floor of the inn at Angers, a
mean, dingy room which looked into a narrow lane, and commanded no prospect
more informing than a blind wall, two men sat, fretting; or, rather,
one man sat, his chin resting on his hand, while his companion, less
patient or more sanguine, strode ceaselessly to and fro.&nbsp; In the
first despair of capture&mdash;for they were prisoners&mdash;they had
made up their minds to the worst, and the slow hours of two days had
passed over their heads without kindling more than a faint spark of
hope in their breasts.&nbsp; But when they had been taken out and forced
to mount and ride&mdash;at first with feet tied to the horses&rsquo;
girths&mdash;they had let the change, the movement, and the open air
fan the flame.&nbsp; They had muttered a word to one another, they had
wondered, they had reasoned.&nbsp; And though the silence of their guards&mdash;from
whose sour vigilance the keenest question drew no response&mdash;seemed
of ill-omen, and, taken with their knowledge of the man into whose hands
they had fallen, should have quenched the spark, these two, having special
reasons, the one the buoyancy of youth, the other the faith of an enthusiast,
cherished the flame.&nbsp; In the breast of one indeed it had blazed
into a confidence so arrogant that he now took all for granted, and
was not content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy for you to say &lsquo;Patience!&rsquo;&rdquo; he
cried, as he walked the floor in a fever.&nbsp; &ldquo;You stand to
lose no more than your life, and if you escape go free at all points!&nbsp;
But he has robbed me of more than life!&nbsp; Of my love, and my self-respect,
curse him!&nbsp; He has worsted me not once, but twice and thrice!&nbsp;
And if he lets me go now, dismissing me with my life, I shall&mdash;I
shall kill him!&rdquo; he concluded, through his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hard to please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That were to fall still lower!&rdquo; the minister answered,
gravely regarding him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would, M. de Tignonville, you
remembered that you are not yet out of jeopardy.&nbsp; Such a frame
of mind as yours is no good preparation for death, let me tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will not kill us!&rdquo; Tignonville cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
knows better than most men how to avenge himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is above most!&rdquo; La Tribe retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
my part I wish I were sure of the fact, and I should sit here more at
ease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could escape, now, of ourselves!&rdquo; Tignonville
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then we should save not only life, but honour!&nbsp;
Man, think of it!&nbsp; If we could escape, not by his leave, but against
it!&nbsp; Are you sure that this is Angers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As sure as a man can be who has only seen the Black Town once
or twice!&rdquo; La Tribe answered, moving to the casement&mdash;which
was not glazed&mdash;and peering through the rough wooden lattice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But if we could escape we are strangers here.&nbsp; We know not
which way to go, nor where to find shelter.&nbsp; And for the matter
of that,&rdquo; he continued, turning from the window with a shrug of
resignation, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis no use to talk of it while yonder foot
goes up and down the passage, and its owner bears the key in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could get out of his power as we came into it!&rdquo;
Tignonville cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, if!&nbsp; But it is not every floor has a trap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could take up a board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could take up a board!&rdquo; the younger man repeated;
and he stepped the mean chamber from end to end, his eyes on the floor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or&mdash;yes, <i>mon Dieu</i>!&rdquo; with a change of attitude,
&ldquo;we might break through the roof?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, throwing back
his head, he scanned the cobwebbed surface of laths which rested on
the unceiled joists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not, Monsieur?&nbsp; Why not break through the ceiling?&rdquo;
Tignonville repeated, and in a fit of energy he seized his companion&rsquo;s
shoulder and shook him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand on the bed, and you can reach
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the floor which rests on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Par Dieu</i>, there is no floor!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a cockloft
above us!&nbsp; See there!&nbsp; And there!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the young
man sprang on the bed, and thrust the rowel of a spur through the laths.&nbsp;
La Tribe&rsquo;s expression changed.&nbsp; He rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Tignonville, his face red, drove the spur again between the laths,
and worked it to and fro until he could pass his fingers into the hole
he had made.&nbsp; Then he gripped and bent down a length of one of
the laths, and, passing his arm as far as the elbow through the hole,
moved it this way and that.&nbsp; His eyes, as he looked down at his
companion through the falling rubbish, gleamed with triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your floor now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can touch nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s open.&nbsp; A little more and I
might touch the tiles.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he strove to reach higher.</p>
<p>For answer La Tribe gripped him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Down!&nbsp; Down, Monsieur,&rdquo;
he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are bringing our dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville thrust back the lath as well as he could, and slipped
to the floor; and hastily the two swept the rubbish from the bed.&nbsp;
When Badelon, attended by two men, came in with the meal he found La
Tribe at the window blocking much of the light, and Tignonville laid
sullenly on the bed.&nbsp; Even a suspicious eye must have failed to
detect what had been done; the three who looked in suspected nothing
and saw nothing.&nbsp; They went out, the key was turned again on the
prisoners, and the footsteps of two of the men were heard descending
the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have an hour, now!&rdquo; Tignonville cried; and leaping,
with flaming eyes, on the bed, he fell to hacking and jabbing and tearing
at the laths amid a rain of dust and rubbish.&nbsp; Fortunately the
stuff, falling on the bed, made little noise; and in five minutes, working
half-choked and in a frenzy of impatience, he had made a hole through
which he could thrust his arms, a hole which extended almost from one
joist to its neighbour.&nbsp; By this time the air was thick with floating
lime; the two could scarcely breathe, yet they dared not pause.&nbsp;
Mounting on La Tribe&rsquo;s shoulders&mdash;who took his stand on the
bed&mdash;the young man thrust his head and arms through the hole, and,
resting his elbows on the joists, dragged himself up, and with a final
effort of strength landed nose and knees on the timbers, which formed
his supports.&nbsp; A moment to take breath, and press his torn and
bleeding fingers to his lips; then, reaching down, he gave a hand to
his companion and dragged him to the same place of vantage.</p>
<p>They found themselves in a long narrow cockloft, not more than six
feet high at the highest, and insufferably hot.&nbsp; Between the tiles,
which sloped steeply on either hand, a faint light filtered in, disclosing
the giant rooftree running the length of the house, and at the farther
end of the loft the main tie-beam, from which a network of knees and
struts rose to the rooftree.</p>
<p>Tignonville, who seemed possessed by unnatural energy, stayed only
to put off his boots.&nbsp; Then &ldquo;Courage!&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;all
goes well!&rdquo; and, carrying his boots in his hands, he led the way,
stepping gingerly from joist to joist until he reached the tie-beam.&nbsp;
He climbed on it, and, squeezing himself between the struts, entered
a second loft, similar to the first.&nbsp; At the farther end of this
a rough wall of bricks in a timber-frame lowered his hopes; but as he
approached it, joy!&nbsp; Low down in the corner where the roof descended,
a small door, square, and not more than two feet high, disclosed itself.</p>
<p>The two crept to it on hands and knees and listened.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
will lead to the leads, I doubt?&rdquo; La Tribe whispered.&nbsp; They
dared not raise their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As well that way as another!&rdquo; Tignonville answered recklessly.&nbsp;
He was the more eager, for there is a fear which transcends the fear
of death.&nbsp; His eyes shone through the mask of dust, the sweat ran
down to his chin, his breath came and went noisily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Naught
matters if we can escape him!&rdquo; he panted.&nbsp; And he pushed
the door recklessly.&nbsp; It flew open; the two drew back their faces
with a cry of alarm.</p>
<p>They were looking, not into the sunlight, but into a grey dingy garret
open to the roof, and occupying the upper part of a gable-end somewhat
higher than the wing in which they had been confined.&nbsp; Filthy truckle-beds
and ragged pallets covered the floor, and, eked out by old saddles and
threadbare horserugs, marked the sleeping quarters either of the servants
or of travellers of the meaner sort.&nbsp; But the dinginess was naught
to the two who knelt looking into it, afraid to move.&nbsp; Was the
place empty?&nbsp; That was the point; the question which had first
stayed, and then set their pulses at the gallop.</p>
<p>Painfully their eyes searched each huddle of clothing, scanned each
dubious shape.&nbsp; And slowly, as the silence persisted, their heads
came forward until the whole floor lay within the field of sight.&nbsp;
And still no sound!&nbsp; At last Tignonville stirred, crept through
the doorway, and rose up, peering round him.&nbsp; He nodded, and, satisfied
that all was safe, the minister followed him.</p>
<p>They found themselves a pace or so from the head of a narrow staircase,
leading downwards.&nbsp; Without moving, they could see the door which
closed it below.&nbsp; Tignonville signed to La Tribe to wait, and himself
crept down the stairs.&nbsp; He reached the door, and, stooping, set
his eye to the hole through which the string of the latch passed.&nbsp;
A moment he looked, and then, turning on tiptoe, he stole up again,
his face fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may throw the handle after the hatchet!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man on guard is within four yards of the door.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And in the rage of disappointment he struck the air with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he looking this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; He is looking down the passage towards our room.&nbsp;
But it is impossible to pass him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe nodded, and moved softly to one of the lattices which lighted
the room.&nbsp; It might be possible to escape that way, by the parapet
and the tiles.&nbsp; But he found that the casement was set high in
the roof, which sloped steeply from its sill to the eaves.&nbsp; He
passed to the other window, in which a little wicket in the lattice
stood open.&nbsp; He looked through it.&nbsp; In the giddy void white
pigeons were wheeling in the dazzling sunshine, and, gazing down, he
saw far below him, in the hot square, a row of booths, and troops of
people moving to and fro like pigmies; and&mdash;and a strange thing,
in the middle of all!&nbsp; Involuntarily, as if the persons below could
have seen his face at the tiny dormer, he drew back.</p>
<p>He beckoned to M. Tignonville to come to him; and when the young
man complied, he bade him in a whisper look down.&nbsp; &ldquo;See!&rdquo;
he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger man saw and drew in his breath.&nbsp; Even under the
coating of dust his face turned a shade greyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no need to fear that he would let us go!&rdquo; the
minister muttered, with half-conscious irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I!&nbsp; There are two ropes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And La Tribe
breathed a few words of prayer.&nbsp; The object which had fixed his
gaze was a gibbet: the only one of the three which could be seen from
their eyrie.</p>
<p>Tignonville, on the other hand, turned sharply away, and with haggard
eyes stared about the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;We might defend the staircase,&rdquo;
he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two men might hold it for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly he gripped La Tribe&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it may do!&nbsp;
It must do!&rdquo; he continued, his face working.&nbsp; &ldquo;See!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And lifting from the floor one of the ragged pallets, from which the
straw protruded in a dozen places, he set it flat on his head.</p>
<p>It drooped at each corner&mdash;it had seen much wear&mdash;and,
while it almost hid his face, it revealed his grimy chin and mortar-stained
shoulders.&nbsp; He turned to his companion.</p>
<p>La Tribe&rsquo;s face glowed as he looked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may do!&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance!&nbsp; But you are right!&nbsp;
It may do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville dropped the ragged mattress, and tore off his coat; then
he rent his breeches at the knee, so that they hung loose about his
calves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you the same!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;And quick,
man, quick!&nbsp; Leave your boots!&nbsp; Once outside we must pass
through the streets under these&rdquo;&mdash;he took up his burden again
and set it on his head&mdash;&ldquo;until we reach a quiet part, and
there we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can hide!&nbsp; Or swim the river!&rdquo; the minister said.&nbsp;
He had followed his companion&rsquo;s example, and now stood under a
similar burden.&nbsp; With breeches rent and whitened, and his upper
garments in no better case, he looked a sorry figure.</p>
<p>Tignonville eyed him with satisfaction, and turned to the staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there is not a moment to be
lost.&nbsp; At any minute they may enter our room and find it empty!&nbsp;
You are ready?&nbsp; Then, not too softly, or it may rouse suspicion!&nbsp;
And mumble something at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began himself to scold, and, muttering incoherently, stumbled
down the staircase, the pallet on his head rustling against the wall
on each side.&nbsp; Arrived at the door, he fumbled clumsily with the
latch, and, when the door gave way, plumped out with an oath&mdash;as
if the awkward burden he bore were the only thing on his mind.&nbsp;
Badelon&mdash;he was on duty&mdash;stared at the apparition; but the
next moment he sniffed the pallet, which was none of the freshest, and,
turning up his nose, he retreated a pace.&nbsp; He had no suspicion;
the men did not come from the part of the house where the prisoners
lay, and he stood aside to let them pass.&nbsp; In a moment, staggering,
and going a little unsteadily, as if they scarcely saw their way, they
had passed by him, and were descending the staircase.</p>
<p>So far well!&nbsp; Unfortunately, when they reached the foot of that
flight they came on the main passage of the first-floor.&nbsp; It ran
right and left, and Tignonville did not know which way he must turn
to reach the lower staircase.&nbsp; Yet he dared not hesitate; in the
passage, waiting about the doors, were four or five servants, and in
the distance he caught sight of three men belonging to Tavannes&rsquo;
company.&nbsp; At any moment, too, an upper servant might meet them,
ask what they were doing, and detect the fraud.&nbsp; He turned at random,
therefore&mdash;to the left as it chanced&mdash;and marched along bravely,
until the very thing happened which he had feared.&nbsp; A man came
from a room plump upon them, saw them, and held up his hands in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he cried in a rage and with an
oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who set you on this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville&rsquo;s tongue clave to the roof of his mouth.&nbsp;
La Tribe from behind muttered something about the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And time too!&rdquo; the man said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faugh!&nbsp;
But how come you this way?&nbsp; Are you drunk?&nbsp; Here!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He opened the door of a musty closet beside him, &ldquo;Pitch them in
here, do you hear?&nbsp; And take them down when it is dark.&nbsp; Faugh.&nbsp;
I wonder you did not carry the things though her ladyship&rsquo;s room
at once!&nbsp; If my lord had been in and met you!&nbsp; Now then, do
as I tell you!&nbsp; Are you drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sullen air Tignonville threw in his mattress.&nbsp; La Tribe
did the same.&nbsp; Fortunately the passage was ill-lighted, and there
were many helpers and strange servants in the inn.&nbsp; The butler
only thought them ill-looking fellows who knew no better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be off!&rdquo; he continued irascibly.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is no place for your sort.&nbsp; Be off!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, as they moved,
&ldquo;Coming!&nbsp; Coming!&rdquo; he cried in answer to a distant
summons; and he hurried away on the errand which their appearance had
interrupted.</p>
<p>Tignonville would have gone to work to recover the pallets, for the
man had left the key in the door.&nbsp; But as he went to do so the
butler looked back, and the two were obliged to make a pretence of following
him.&nbsp; A moment, however, and he was gone; and Tignonville turned
anew to regain them.&nbsp; A second time fortune was adverse; a door
within a pace of him opened, a woman came out.&nbsp; She recoiled from
the strange figure; her eyes met his.&nbsp; Unluckily the light from
the room behind her fell on his face, and with a shrill cry she named
him.</p>
<p>One second and all had been lost, for the crowd of idlers at the
other end of the passage had caught her cry, and were looking that way.&nbsp;
With presence of mind Tignonville clapped his hand on her mouth, and,
huddling her by force into the room, followed her, with La Tribe at
his heels.</p>
<p>It was a large room, in which seven or eight people, who had been
at prayers when the cry startled them, were rising from their knees.&nbsp;
The first thing they saw was Javette on the threshold, struggling in
the grasp of a wild man, ragged and begrimed; they deemed the city risen
and the massacre upon them.&nbsp; Carlat threw himself before his mistress,
the Countess in her turn sheltered a young girl, who stood beside her
and from whose face the last trace of colour had fled.&nbsp; Madame
Carlat and a waiting-woman ran shrieking to the window; another instant
and the alarm would have gone abroad.</p>
<p>Tignonville&rsquo;s voice stopped it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know me?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Madame! you at least!&nbsp; Carlat!&nbsp;
Are you all mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words stayed them where they stood in an astonishment scarce
less than their alarm.&nbsp; The Countess tried twice to speak; the
third time&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you escaped?&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>Tignonville nodded, his eyes bright with triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;So
far,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But they may be on our heels at any
moment!&nbsp; Where can we hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess, her hand pressed to her side, looked at Javette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door, girl!&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lock it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lock it!&nbsp; And they can go by the back-stairs,&rdquo;
Madame Carlat answered, awaking suddenly to the situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Through
my closet!&nbsp; Once in the yard they may pass out through the stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; Tignonville asked impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
stand looking at me, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through this door!&rdquo; Madame Carlat answered, hurrying
to it.</p>
<p>He was following when the Countess stepped forward and interposed
between him and the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she cried; and there was not one who did not
notice a new decision in her voice, a new dignity in her bearing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stay, Monsieur, we may be going too fast.&nbsp; To go out now
and in that guise&mdash;may it not be to incur greater peril than you
incur here?&nbsp; I feel sure that you are in no danger of your life
at present.&nbsp; Therefore, why run the risk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In no danger, Madame!&rdquo; he cried, interrupting her in
astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you seen the gibbet in the Square?&nbsp;
Do you call that no danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not erected for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur,&rdquo; she answered firmly, &ldquo;I swear it
is not.&nbsp; And I know of reasons, urgent reasons, why you should
not go.&nbsp; M. de Tavannes&rdquo;&mdash;she named her husband nervously,
as conscious of the weak spot&mdash;&ldquo;before he rode abroad laid
strict orders on all to keep within, since the smallest matter might
kindle the city.&nbsp; Therefore, M. de Tignonville, I request, nay
I entreat,&rdquo; she continued with greater urgency, as she saw his
gesture of denial, &ldquo;you to stay here until he returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Madame, will answer for my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She faltered.&nbsp; For a moment, a moment only, her colour ebbed.&nbsp;
What if she deceived herself?&nbsp; What if she surrendered her old
lover to death?&nbsp; What if&mdash;but the doubt was of a moment only.&nbsp;
Her duty was plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer for it,&rdquo; she said, with pale lips, &ldquo;if
you remain here.&nbsp; And I beg, I implore you&mdash;by the love you
once had for me, M. de Tignonville,&rdquo; she added desperately, seeing
that he was about to refuse, &ldquo;to remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once!&rdquo; he retorted, lashing himself into ignoble rage.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the love I once had!&nbsp; Say, rather, the love I have, Madame&mdash;for
I am no woman-weathercock to wed the winner, and hold or not hold, stay
or go, as he commands!&nbsp; You, it seems,&rdquo; he continued with
a sneer, &ldquo;have learned the wife&rsquo;s lesson well!&nbsp; You
would practise on me now, as you practised on me the other night when
you stood between him and me!&nbsp; I yielded then, I spared him.&nbsp;
And what did I get by it?&nbsp; Bonds and a prison!&nbsp; And what shall
I get now?&nbsp; The same!&nbsp; No, Madame,&rdquo; he continued bitterly,
addressing himself as much to the Carlats and the others as to his old
mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not change!&nbsp; I loved!&nbsp; I love!&nbsp;
I was going and I go!&nbsp; If death lay beyond that door&rdquo;&mdash;and
he pointed to it&mdash;&ldquo;and life at his will were certain here,
I would pass the threshold rather than take my life of him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, dragging La Tribe with him, with a passionate gesture he rushed
by her, opened the door, and disappeared in the next room.</p>
<p>The Countess took one pace forward, as if she would have followed
him, as if she would have tried further persuasion.&nbsp; But as she
moved a cry rooted her to the spot.&nbsp; A rush of feet and the babel
of many voices filled the passage with a tide of sound, which drew rapidly
nearer.&nbsp; The escape was known!&nbsp; Would the fugitives have time
to slip out below?</p>
<p>Some one knocked at the door, tried it, pushed and beat on it.&nbsp;
But the Countess and all in the room had run to the windows and were
looking out.</p>
<p>If the two had not yet made their escape they must be taken.&nbsp;
Yet no; as the Countess leaned from the window, first one dusty figure
and then a second darted from a door below, and made for the nearest
turning, out of the Place Ste.-Croix.&nbsp; Before they gained it, four
men, of whom, Badelon, his grey locks flying, was first, dashed out
in pursuit, and the street rang with cries of &ldquo;Stop him!&nbsp;
Seize him!&nbsp; Seize him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Some one&mdash;one of the pursuers
or another&mdash;to add to the alarm let off a musket, and in a moment,
as if the report had been a signal, the Place was in a hubbub, people
flocked into it with mysterious quickness, and from a neighbouring roof&mdash;whence,
precisely, it was impossible to say&mdash;the crackling fire of a dozen
arquebuses alarmed the city far and wide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fugitives had been baulked at the first turning.&nbsp;
Making for a second, they found it choked, and, swerving, darted across
the Place towards St.-Maurice, seeking to lose themselves in the gathering
crowd.&nbsp; But the pursuers clung desperately to their skirts, overturning
here a man and there a child; and then in a twinkling, Tignonville,
as he ran round a booth, tripped over a peg and fell, and La Tribe stumbled
over him and fell also.&nbsp; The four riders flung themselves fiercely
on their prey, secured them, and began to drag them with oaths and curses
towards the door of the inn.</p>
<p>The Countess had seen all from her window; had held her breath while
they ran, had drawn it sharply when they fell.&nbsp; Now, &ldquo;They
have them!&rdquo; she muttered, a sob choking her, &ldquo;they have
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she clasped her hands.&nbsp; If he had followed
her advice!&nbsp; If he had only followed her advice!</p>
<p>But the issue proved less certain than she deemed it.&nbsp; The crowd,
which grew each moment, knew nothing of pursuers or pursued.&nbsp; On
the contrary, a cry went up that the riders were Huguenots, and that
the Huguenots were rising and slaying the Catholics; and as no story
was too improbable for those days, and this was one constantly set about,
first one stone flew, and then another, and another.&nbsp; A man with
a staff darted forward and struck Badelon on the shoulder, two or three
others pressed in and jostled the riders; and if three of Tavannes&rsquo;
following had not run out on the instant and faced the mob with their
pikes, and for a moment forced them to give back, the prisoners would
have been rescued at the very door of the inn.&nbsp; As it was they
were dragged in, and the gates were flung to and barred in the nick
of time.&nbsp; Another moment, almost another second, and the mob had
seized them.&nbsp; As it was, a hail of stones poured on the front of
the inn, and amid the rising yells of the rabble there presently floated
heavy and slow over the city the tolling of the great bell of St.-Maurice.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.&nbsp; SACRILEGE!</h2>
<p>M. de Montsoreau, Lieutenant-Governor of Saumur almost rose from
his seat in his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; No letters?&rdquo; he cried, a hand on either
arm of the chair.</p>
<p>The Magistrates stared, one and all.&nbsp; &ldquo;No letters?&rdquo;
they muttered.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;No letters?&rdquo; the Provost chimed in more faintly.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal looked smiling round the Council table.&nbsp; He alone
was unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I bear none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Montsoreau, who, travel-stained and in his corselet, had the
second place of honour at the foot of the table, frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my instructions from
Monsieur were to proceed to carry out his Majesty&rsquo;s will in co-operation
with you, who, I understood, would bring letters <i>de par le Roi</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had letters,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered negligently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But on the way I mislaid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mislaid them?&rdquo; Montsoreau cried, unable to believe his
ears; while the smaller dignitaries of the city, the magistrates and
churchmen who sat on either side of the table, gaped open-mouthed.&nbsp;
It was incredible!&nbsp; It was unbelievable!&nbsp; Mislay the King&rsquo;s
letters!&nbsp; Who had ever heard of such a thing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mislaid them.&nbsp; Lost them, if you like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you jest!&rdquo; the Lieutenant-Governor retorted, moving
uneasily in his chair.&nbsp; He was a man more highly named for address
than courage; and, like most men skilled in finesse, he was prone to
suspect a trap.&nbsp; &ldquo;You jest, surely, Monsieur!&nbsp; Men do
not lose his Majesty&rsquo;s letters, by the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they contain his Majesty&rsquo;s will, no,&rdquo; Tavannes
answered, with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imply, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal shrugged his shoulders, but had not answered when
Bigot entered and handed him his sweetmeat box; he paused to open it
and select a prune.&nbsp; He was long in selecting; but no change of
countenance led any of those at the table to suspect that inside the
lid of the box was a message&mdash;a scrap of paper informing him that
Montsoreau had left fifty spears in the suburb without the Saumur gate,
besides those whom he had brought openly into the town.&nbsp; Tavannes
read the note slowly while he seemed to be choosing his fruit.&nbsp;
And then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imply?&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I imply nothing, M.
de Montsoreau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that sometimes his Majesty finds it prudent to give orders
which he does not mean to be carried out.&nbsp; There are things which
start up before the eye,&rdquo; Tavannes continued, negligently tapping
the box on the table, &ldquo;and there are things which do not; sometimes
the latter are the more important.&nbsp; You, better than I, M. de Montsoreau,
know that the King in the Gallery at the Louvre is one, and in his closet
is another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that being so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to carry the letters into effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had I the letters, certainly, my friend.&nbsp; I should be
bound by them.&nbsp; But I took good care to lose them,&rdquo; Tavannes
added na&iuml;vely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Count Hannibal continued, with an airy gesture,
&ldquo;that is my affair.&nbsp; If you, M. de Montsoreau, feel inclined,
in spite of the absence of my letters, to carry yours into effect, by
all means do so&mdash;after midnight of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. de Montsoreau breathed hard.&nbsp; &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; he asked,
half sulkily and half ponderously, &ldquo;after midnight only, M. le
Comte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that I may be clear of all suspicion of having lot
or part in the matter,&rdquo; Count Hannibal answered pleasantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After midnight of to-night by all means do as you please.&nbsp;
Until midnight, by your leave, we will be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant-Governor moved doubtfully in his chair, the fear&mdash;which
Tavannes had shrewdly instilled into his mind&mdash;that he might be
disowned if he carried out his instructions, struggling with his avarice
and his self-importance.&nbsp; He was rather crafty than bold; and such
things had been, he knew.&nbsp; Little by little, and while he sat gloomily
debating, the notion of dealing with one or two and holding the body
of the Huguenots to ransom&mdash;a notion which, in spite of everything,
was to bear good fruit for Angers&mdash;began to form in his mind.&nbsp;
The plan suited him: it left him free to face either way, and it would
fill his pockets more genteelly than would open robbery.&nbsp; On the
other hand, he would offend his brother and the fanatical party, with
whom he commonly acted.&nbsp; They were looking to see him assert himself.&nbsp;
They were looking to hear him declare himself.&nbsp; And&mdash;</p>
<p>Harshly Count Hannibal&rsquo;s voice broke in on his thoughts; harshly,
a something sinister in its tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your brother?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And it was evident
that he had not noted his absence until then.&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord&rsquo;s
Vicar of all people should be here!&rdquo; he continued, leaning forward
and looking round the table.&nbsp; His brow was stormy.</p>
<p>Lescot squirmed under his eye; Thuriot turned pale and trembled.&nbsp;
It was one of the canons of St.-Maurice, who at length took on himself
to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His lordship requested, M. le Comte,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;that
you would excuse him.&nbsp; His duties&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he ill, sirrah?&rdquo; Tavannes roared.&nbsp; And while
all bowed before the lightning of his eye, no man at the table knew
what had roused the sudden tempest.&nbsp; But Bigot knew, who stood
by the door, and whose ear, keen as his master&rsquo;s, had caught the
distant report of a musket shot.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he be not ill,&rdquo;
Tavannes continued, rising and looking round the table in search of
signs of guilt, &ldquo;and there be foul play here, and he the player,
the Bishop&rsquo;s own hand shall not save him!&nbsp; By Heaven it shall
not!&nbsp; Nor yours!&rdquo; he continued, looking fiercely at Montsoreau.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nor your master&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lieutenant-Governor sprang to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;M. le Comte,&rdquo;
he stammered, &ldquo;I do not understand this language!&nbsp; Nor this
heat, which may be real or not!&nbsp; All I say is, if there be foul
play here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If!&rdquo; Tavannes retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least, if there
be, there be gibbets too!&nbsp; And I see necks!&rdquo; he added, leaning
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Necks!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, with a look of flame,
&ldquo;Let no man leave this table until I return,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;or he will have to deal with me.&nbsp; Nay,&rdquo; he continued,
changing his tone abruptly, as the prudence, which never entirely left
him&mdash;and perhaps the remembrance of the other&rsquo;s fifty spearmen&mdash;sobered
him in the midst of his rage, &ldquo;I am hasty.&nbsp; I mean not you,
M. de Montsoreau!&nbsp; Ride where you will; ride with me, if you will,
and I will thank you.&nbsp; Only remember, until midnight Angers is
mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still speaking when he moved from the table, and, leaving
all staring after him, strode down the room.&nbsp; An instant he paused
on the threshold and looked back; then he passed out, and clattered
down the stone stairs.&nbsp; His horse and riders were waiting, but,
his foot in the stirrup, he stayed for a word with Bigot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>The Norman did not speak, but pointed towards the Place Ste.-Croix,
whence an occasional shot made answer for him.</p>
<p>In those days the streets of the Black City were narrow and crooked,
overhung by timber houses, and hampered by booths; nor could Tavannes
from the old Town Hall&mdash;now abandoned&mdash;see the Place Ste.-Croix.&nbsp;
But that he could cure.&nbsp; He struck spurs to his horse, and, followed
by his ten horsemen, he clattered noisily down the paved street.&nbsp;
A dozen groups hurrying the same way sprang panic-stricken to the walls,
or saved themselves in doorways.&nbsp; He was up with them, he was beyond
them!&nbsp; Another hundred yards, and he would see the Place.</p>
<p>And then, with a cry of rage, he drew rein a little, discovering
what was before him.&nbsp; In the narrow gut of the way a great black
banner, borne on two poles, was lurching towards him.&nbsp; It was moving
in the van of a dark procession of priests, who, with their attendants
and a crowd of devout, filled the street from wall to wall.&nbsp; They
were chanting one of the penitential psalms, but not so loudly as to
drown the uproar in the Place beyond them.</p>
<p>They made no way, and Count Hannibal swore furiously, suspecting
treachery.&nbsp; But he was no madman, and at the moment the least reflection
would have sent him about to seek another road.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
as he hesitated a man sprang with a gesture of warning to his horse&rsquo;s
head and seized it; and Tavannes, mistaking the motive of the act, lost
his self-control.&nbsp; He struck the fellow down, and, with a reckless
word, rode headlong into the procession, shouting to the black robes
to make way, make way!&nbsp; A cry, nay, a shriek of horror, answered
him and rent the air.&nbsp; And in a minute the thing was done.&nbsp;
Too late, as the Bishop&rsquo;s Vicar, struck by his horse, fell screaming
under its hoofs&mdash;too late, as the consecrated vessels which he
had been bearing rolled in the mud, Tavannes saw that they bore the
canopy and the Host!</p>
<p>He knew what he had done, then.&nbsp; Before his horse&rsquo;s iron
shoes struck the ground again, his face&mdash;even his face&mdash;had
lost its colour.&nbsp; But he knew also that to hesitate now, to pause
now, was to be torn in pieces; for his riders, seeing that which the
banner had veiled from him, had not followed him, and he was alone,
in the middle of brandished fists and weapons.&nbsp; He hesitated not
a moment.&nbsp; Drawing a pistol, he spurred onwards, his horse plunging
wildly among the shrieking priests; and though a hundred hands, hands
of acolytes, hands of shaven monks, clutched at his bridle or gripped
his boot, he got clear of them.&nbsp; Clear, carrying with him the memory
of one face seen an instant amid the crowd, one face seen, to be ever
remembered&mdash;the face of Father Pezelay, white, evil, scarred, distorted
by wicked triumph.</p>
<p>Behind him, the thunder of &ldquo;Sacrilege!&nbsp; Sacrilege!&rdquo;
rose to Heaven, and men were gathering.&nbsp; In front the crowd which
skirmished about the inn was less dense, and, ignorant of the thing
that had happened in the narrow street, made ready way for him, the
boldest recoiling before the look on his face.&nbsp; Some who stood
nearest to the inn, and had begun to hurl stones at the window and to
beat on the doors&mdash;which had only the minute before closed on Badelon
and his prisoners&mdash;supposed that he had his riders behind him;
and these fled apace.&nbsp; But he knew better even than they the value
of time; he pushed his horse up to the gates, and hammered them with
his boot while be kept his pistol-hand towards the Place and the cathedral,
watching for the transformation which he knew would come!</p>
<p>And come it did; on a sudden, in a twinkling!&nbsp; A white-faced
monk, frenzy in his eyes, appeared in the midst of the crowd.&nbsp;
He stood and tore his garments before the people, and, stooping, threw
dust on his head.&nbsp; A second and a third followed his example; then
from a thousand throats the cry of &ldquo;Sacrilege!&nbsp; Sacrilege!&rdquo;
rolled up, while clerks flew wildly hither and thither shrieking the
tale, and priests denied the Sacraments to Angers until it should purge
itself of the evil thing.</p>
<p>By that time Count Hannibal had saved himself behind the great gates,
by the skin of his teeth.&nbsp; The gates had opened to him in time.&nbsp;
But none knew better than he that Angers had no gates thick enough,
nor walls of a height, to save him for many hours from the storm he
had let loose!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.&nbsp; THE FLIGHT FROM ANGERS.</h2>
<p>But that only the more roused the devil in the man; that, and the
knowledge that he had his own headstrong act to thank for the position.&nbsp;
He looked on the panic-stricken people who, scared by the turmoil without,
had come together in the courtyard, wringing their hands and chattering;
and his face was so dark and forbidding that fear of him took the place
of all other fear, and the nearest shrank from contact with him.&nbsp;
On any other entering as he had entered, they would have hailed questions;
they would have asked what was amiss, and if the city were rising, and
where were Bigot and his men.&nbsp; But Count Hannibal&rsquo;s eye struck
curiosity dumb.&nbsp; When he cried from his saddle, &ldquo;Bring me
the landlord!&rdquo; the trembling man was found, and brought, and thrust
forward almost without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a back gate?&rdquo; Tavannes said, while the crowd
leaned forward to catch his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; the man faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the street which leads to the ramparts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;to Badelon&mdash;&ldquo;saddle!&nbsp; You
have five minutes.&nbsp; Saddle as you never saddled before,&rdquo;
he continued in a low tone, &ldquo;or&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; His tongue
did not finish the threat, but his hand waved the man away.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
you&rdquo;&mdash;he held Tignonville an instant with his lowering eye&mdash;&ldquo;and
the preaching fool with you, get arms and mount!&nbsp; You have never
played aught but the woman yet; but play me false now, or look aside
but a foot from the path I bid you take, and you thwart me no more,
Monsieur!&nbsp; And you, Madame,&rdquo; he continued, turning to the
Countess, who stood bewildered at one of the doors, the Provost&rsquo;s
daughter clinging and weeping about her, &ldquo;you have three minutes
to get your women to horse!&nbsp; See you, if you please, that they
take no longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found her voice with difficulty.&nbsp; &ldquo;And this child?&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is in my care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring her,&rdquo; he muttered with a scowl of impatience.&nbsp;
And then, raising his voice as he turned on the terrified gang of hostlers
and inn servants who stood gaping round him, &ldquo;Go help!&rdquo;
he thundered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go help!&nbsp; And quickly!&rdquo; he added,
his face growing a shade darker as a second bell began to toll from
a neighbouring tower, and the confused babel in the Place Ste.-Croix
settled into a dull roar of &ldquo;<i>Sacril&egrave;ge</i>! <i>sacril&egrave;ge</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hasten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately it had been his first intention to go to the Council
attended by the whole of his troop; and eight horses stood saddled in
the stalls.&nbsp; Others were hastily pulled out and bridled, and the
women were mounted.&nbsp; La Tribe, at a look from Tavannes, took behind
him the Provost&rsquo;s daughter, who was helpless with terror.&nbsp;
Between the suddenness of the alarm, the uproar without, and the panic
within, none but a man whose people served him at a nod and dreaded
his very gesture could have got his party mounted in time.&nbsp; Javette
would fain have swooned, but she dared not.&nbsp; Tignonville would
fain have questioned, but he shrank from the venture.&nbsp; The Countess
would fain have said something, but she forced herself to obey and no
more.&nbsp; Even so the confusion in the courtyard, the mingling of
horses and men and trappings and saddle-bags, would have made another
despair; but wherever Count Hannibal, seated in his saddle in the middle,
turned his face, chaos settled into a degree of order, servants, ceasing
to listen to the yells and cries outside, ran to fetch, women dropped
cloaks from the gallery, and men loaded muskets and strapped on bandoliers.</p>
<p>Until at last&mdash;but none knew what those minutes of suspense
cost him&mdash;he saw all mounted, and, pistol in hand, shepherded them
to the back gates.&nbsp; As he did so he stooped for a few scowling
words with Badelon, whom he sent to the van of the party: then he gave
the word to open.&nbsp; It was done; and even as Montsoreau&rsquo;s
horsemen, borne on the bosom of a second and more formidable throng,
swept raging into the already crowded square, and the cry went up for
&ldquo;a ram! a ram!&rdquo; to batter in the gates, Tavannes, hurling
his little party before him, dashed out at the back, and putting to
flight a handful of rascals who had wandered to that side, cantered
unmolested down the lane to the ramparts.&nbsp; Turning eastward at
the foot of the frowning Castle, he followed the inner side of the wall
in the direction of the gate by which he had entered the preceding evening.</p>
<p>To gain this his party had to pass the end of the Rue Toussaint,
which issues from the Place Ste.-Croix and runs so straight that the
mob seething in front of the inn had only to turn their heads to see
them.&nbsp; The danger incurred at this point was great; for a party
as small as Tavannes&rsquo; and encumbered with women would have had
no chance if attacked within the walls.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal knew it.&nbsp; But he knew also that the act which
he had committed rendered the north bank of the Loire impossible for
him.&nbsp; Neither King nor Marshal, neither Charles of Valois nor Gaspard
of Tavannes, would dare to shield him from an infuriated Church, a Church
too wise to forgive certain offences.&nbsp; His one chance lay in reaching
the southern bank of the Loire&mdash;roughly speaking, the Huguenot
bank&mdash;and taking refuge in some town, Rochelle or St. Jean d&rsquo;Angely,
where the Huguenots were strong, and whence he might take steps to set
himself right with his own side.</p>
<p>But to cross the great river which divides France into two lands
widely differing he must leave the city by the east gate; for the only
bridge over the Loire within forty miles of Angers lay eastward from
the town, at Ponts de C&eacute;, four miles away.&nbsp; To this gate,
therefore, past the Rue Toussaint, he whirled his party daringly; and
though the women grew pale as the sounds of riot broke louder on the
ear, and they discovered that they were approaching instead of leaving
the danger&mdash;and though Tignonville for an instant thought him mad,
and snatched at the Countess&rsquo;s rein&mdash;his men-at-arms, who
knew him, galloped stolidly on, passed like clockwork the end of the
street, and, reckless of the stream of persons hurrying in the direction
of the alarm, heedless of the fright and anger their passage excited,
pressed steadily on.&nbsp; A moment and the gate through which they
had entered the previous evening appeared before them.&nbsp; And&mdash;a
sight welcome to one of them&mdash;it was open.</p>
<p>They were fortunate indeed, for a few seconds later they had been
too late.&nbsp; The alarm had preceded them.&nbsp; As they dashed up,
a man ran to the chains of the portcullis and tried to lower it.&nbsp;
He failed to do so at the first touch, and, quailing, fled from Badelon&rsquo;s
levelled pistol.&nbsp; A watchman on one of the bastions of the wall
shouted to them to halt or he would fire: but the riders yelled in derision,
and thundering through the echoing archway, emerged into the open, and
saw, extended before them, in place of the gloomy vistas of the Black
Town, the glory of the open country and the vine-clad hills, and the
fields about the Loire yellow with late harvest.</p>
<p>The women gasped their relief, and one or two who were most out of
breath would have pulled up their horses and let them trot, thinking
the danger at an end.&nbsp; But a curt savage word from the rear set
them flying again, and down and up and on again they galloped, driven
forward by the iron hand which never relaxed its grip of them.&nbsp;
Silent and pitiless he whirled them before him until they were within
a mile of the long Ponts de C&eacute;&mdash;a series of bridges rather
than one bridge&mdash;and the broad shallow Loire lay plain before them,
its sandbanks grilling in the sun, and grey lines of willows marking
its eyots.&nbsp; By this time some of the women, white with fatigue,
could only cling to their saddles with their hands; while others were
red-hot, their hair unrolled, and the perspiration mingled with the
dust on their faces.&nbsp; But he who drove them had no pity for weakness
in an emergency.&nbsp; He looked back and saw, a half-mile behind them,
the glitter of steel following hard on their heels: and &ldquo;Faster!
faster!&rdquo; he cried, regardless of their prayers: and he beat the
rearmost of the horses with his scabbard.&nbsp; A waiting-woman shrieked
that she should fall, but he answered ruthlessly, &ldquo;Fall then,
fool!&rdquo; and the instinct of self-preservation coming to her aid,
she clung and bumped and toiled on with the rest until they reached
the first houses of the town about the bridges, and Badelon raised his
hand as a signal that they might slacken speed.</p>
<p>The bewilderment of the start had been so great that it was then
only, when they found their feet on the first link of the bridge, that
two of the party, the Countess and Tignonville, awoke to the fact that
their faces were set southwards.&nbsp; To cross the Loire in those days
meant much to all: to a Huguenot, very much.&nbsp; It chanced that these
two rode on to the bridge side by side, and the memory of their last
crossing&mdash;the remembrance that, on their journey north a month
before, they had crossed it hand-in-hand with the prospect of passing
their lives together, and with no faintest thought of the events which
were to ensue, flashed into the mind of each of them.&nbsp; It deepened
the flush which exertion had brought to the woman&rsquo;s cheek, then
left it paler than before.&nbsp; A minute earlier she had been wroth
with her old lover; she had held him accountable for the outbreak in
the town and this hasty retreat; now her anger died as she looked and
she remembered.&nbsp; In the man, shallower of feeling and more alive
to present contingencies, the uppermost emotion as he trod the bridge
was one of surprise and congratulation.</p>
<p>He could not at first believe in their good fortune.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Mon
Dieu</i>!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we are crossing!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
then again in a lower tone, &ldquo;We are crossing!&nbsp; We are crossing!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he looked at her.</p>
<p>It was impossible that she should not look back; that she who had
ceased to be angry should not feel and remember; impossible that her
answering glance should not speak to his heart.&nbsp; Below them, as
on that day a month earlier, when they had crossed the bridges going
northward, the broad shallow river ran its course in the sunshine, its
turbid currents gleaming and flashing about the sandbanks and osier-beds.&nbsp;
To the eye, the landscape, save that the vintage was farther advanced
and the harvest in part gathered in, was the same.&nbsp; But how changed
were their relations, their prospects, their hopes, who had then crossed
the river hand-in-hand, planning a life to be passed together.</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s rage boiled up at the thought.&nbsp; Too vividly,
too sharply it showed him the wrongs which he had suffered at the hands
of the man who rode behind him, the man who even now drove him on and
ordered him and insulted him.&nbsp; He forgot that he might have perished
in the general massacre if Count Hannibal had not intervened.&nbsp;
He forgot that Count Hannibal had spared him once and twice.&nbsp; He
laid on his enemy&rsquo;s shoulders the guilt of all, the blood of all:
and, as quick on the thought of his wrongs and his fellows&rsquo; wrongs
followed the reflection that with every league they rode southwards
the chance of requital grew, he cried again, and this time joyously&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are crossing!&nbsp; A little, and we shall be in our own
land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears filled the Countess&rsquo;s eyes as she looked westwards
and southwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vrillac is there!&rdquo; she cried; and she pointed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I smell the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; he answered, almost under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
lies there!&nbsp; And no more than thirty leagues from us!&nbsp; With
fresh horses we might see it in two days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Badelon&rsquo;s voice broke in on them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
he cried, as the party reached the southern bank.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>En
avant</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, obedient to the word, the little company,
refreshed by the short respite, took the road out of Ponts de C&eacute;
at a steady trot.&nbsp; Nor was the Countess the only one whose face
glowed, being set southwards, or whose heart pulsed to the rhythm of
the horses&rsquo; hoofs that beat out &ldquo;Home!&rdquo;&nbsp; Carlat&rsquo;s
and Madame Carlat&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; Javette even, hearing from her
neighbour that they were over the Loire, plucked up courage; while La
Tribe, gazing before him with moistened eyes, cried &ldquo;Comfort&rdquo;
to the scared and weeping girl who clung to his belt.&nbsp; It was singular
to see how all sniffed the air as if already it smacked of the sea and
of the south; and how they of Poitou sat their horses as if they asked
nothing better than to ride on and on and on until the scenes of home
arose about them.&nbsp; For them the sky had already a deeper blue,
the air a softer fragrance, the sunshine a purity long unknown.</p>
<p>Was it wonderful, when they had suffered so much on that northern
bank?&nbsp; When their experience during the month had been comparable
only with the direst nightmare?&nbsp; Yet one among them, after the
first impulse of relief and satisfaction, felt differently.&nbsp; Tignonville&rsquo;s
gorge rose against the sense of compulsion, of inferiority.&nbsp; To
be driven forward after this fashion, whether he would or no, to be
placed at the back of every base-born man-at-arms, to have no clearer
knowledge of what had happened or of what was passing, or of the peril
from which they fled, than the women among whom he rode&mdash;these
things kindled anew the sullen fire of hate.&nbsp; North of the Loire
there had been some excuse for his inaction under insult; he had been
in the man&rsquo;s country and power.&nbsp; But south of the Loire,
within forty leagues of Huguenot Niort, must he still suffer, still
be supine?</p>
<p>His rage was inflamed by a disappointment he presently underwent.&nbsp;
Looking back as they rode clear of the wooden houses of Ponts de C&eacute;,
he missed Tavannes and several of his men; and he wondered if Count
Hannibal had remained on his own side of the river.&nbsp; It seemed
possible; and in that event La Tribe and he and Carlat might deal with
Badelon and the four who still escorted them.&nbsp; But when he looked
back a minute later, Tavannes was within sight, following the party
with a stern face; and not Tavannes only.&nbsp; Bigot, with two of the
ten men who hitherto had been missing, was with him.</p>
<p>It was clear, however, that they brought no good news, for they had
scarcely ridden up before Count Hannibal cried, &ldquo;Faster! faster!&rdquo;
in his harshest voice, and Bigot urged the horses to a quicker trot.&nbsp;
Their course lay almost parallel with the Loire in the direction of
Beaupr&eacute;au; and Tignonville began to fear that Count Hannibal
intended to recross the river at Nantes, where the only bridge below
Angers spanned the stream.&nbsp; With this in view it was easy to comprehend
his wish to distance his pursuers before he recrossed.</p>
<p>The Countess had no such thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;They must be close
upon us!&rdquo; she murmured, as she urged her horse in obedience to
the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever they are!&rdquo; Tignonville muttered bitterly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If we knew what had happened, or who followed, we should know
more about it, Madame.&nbsp; For that matter, I know what I wish he
would do.&nbsp; And our heads are set for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make for Vrillac!&rdquo; he answered, a savage gleam in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Vrillac?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if he would!&rdquo; she cried, her face turning pale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If he would.&nbsp; He would be safe there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, quite safe!&rdquo; he answered with a peculiar intonation.&nbsp;
And he looked at her askance.</p>
<p>He fancied that his thought, the thought which had just flashed into
his brain, was her thought; that she had the same notion in reserve,
and that they were in sympathy.&nbsp; And Tavannes, seeing them talking
together, and noting her look and the fervour of her gesture, formed
the same opinion, and retired more darkly into himself.&nbsp; The downfall
of his plan for dazzling her by a magnanimity unparalleled and beyond
compare, a plan dependent on the submission of Angers&mdash;his disappointment
in this might have roused the worst passions of a better man.&nbsp;
But there was in this man a pride on a level at least with his other
passions: and to bear himself in this hour of defeat and flight so that
if she could not love him she must admire him, checked in a strange
degree the current of his rage.</p>
<p>When Tignonville presently looked back he found that Count Hannibal
and six of his riders had pulled up and were walking their horses far
in the rear.&nbsp; On which he would have done the same himself; but
Badelon called over his shoulder the eternal &ldquo;Forward, Monsieur,
<i>en avant</i>!&rdquo; and sullenly, hating the man and his master
more deeply every hour, Tignonville was forced to push on, with thoughts
of vengeance in his heart.</p>
<p>Trot, trot!&nbsp; Trot, trot!&nbsp; Through a country which had lost
its smiling wooded character and grew more sombre and less fertile the
farther they left the Loire behind them.&nbsp; Trot, trot!&nbsp; Trot,
trot!&mdash;for ever, it seemed to some.&nbsp; Javette wept with fatigue,
and the other women were little better.&nbsp; The Countess herself spoke
seldom except to cheer the Provost&rsquo;s daughter; who, poor girl,
flung suddenly out of the round of her life and cast among strangers,
showed a better spirit than might have been expected.&nbsp; At length,
on the slopes of some low hills, which they had long seen before them,
a cluster of houses and a church appeared; and Badelon, drawing rein,
cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaupr&eacute;au, Madame!&nbsp; We stay an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; They had ridden some hours without
a break.&nbsp; With sighs and cries of pain the women dropped from their
clumsy saddles, while the men laid out such food&mdash;it was little&mdash;as
had been brought, and hobbled the horses that they might feed.&nbsp;
The hour passed rapidly, and when it had passed Badelon was inexorable.&nbsp;
There was wailing when he gave the word to mount again; and Tignonville,
fiercely resenting this dumb, reasonless flight, was at heart one of
the mutineers.&nbsp; But Badelon said grimly that they might go on and
live, or stay and die, as it pleased them; and once more they climbed
painfully to their saddles, and jogged steadily on through the sunset,
through the gloaming, through the darkness, across a weird, mysterious
country of low hills and narrow plains which grew more wild and less
cultivated as they advanced.&nbsp; Fortunately the horses had been well
saved during the long leisurely journey to Angers, and now went well
and strongly.&nbsp; When they at last unsaddled for the night in a little
dismal wood within a mile of Clisson, they had placed some forty miles
between themselves and Angers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.&nbsp; THE ORDEAL BY STEEL.</h2>
<p>The women for the most part fell like sacks and slept where they
alighted, dead weary.&nbsp; The men, when they had cared for the horses,
followed the example; for Badelon would suffer no fire.&nbsp; In less
than half an hour, a sentry who stood on guard at the edge of the wood,
and Tignonville and La Tribe, who talked in low voices with their backs
against a tree, were the only persons who remained awake, with the exception
of the Countess.&nbsp; Carlat had made a couch for her, and screened
it with cloaks from the wind and the eye; for the moon had risen and
where the trees stood sparsest its light flooded the soil with pools
of white.&nbsp; But Madame had not yet retired to her bed.&nbsp; The
two men, whose voices reached her, saw her from time to time moving
restlessly to and fro between the road and the little encampment.&nbsp;
Presently she came and stood over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He led His people out of the wilderness,&rdquo; La Tribe was
saying; &ldquo;out of the trouble of Paris, out of the trouble of Angers,
and always, always southward.&nbsp; If you do not in this, Monsieur,
see His finger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Angers?&rdquo; Tignonville struck in, with a faint sneer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Has He led that out of trouble?&nbsp; A day or two ago you would
risk all to save it, my friend.&nbsp; Now, with your back safely turned
on it, you think all for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did our best,&rdquo; the minister answered humbly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From the day we met in Paris we have been but instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save Angers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save a remnant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a sudden the Countess raised her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not
hear horses, Monsieur?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; She had been listening
to the noises of the night, and had paid little heed to what the two
were saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of ours moved,&rdquo; Tignonville answered listlessly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why do you not lie down, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of answering, &ldquo;Whither is he going?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I did know,&rdquo; the young man answered peevishly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To Niort, it may be.&nbsp; Or presently he will double back and
recross the Loire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have gone by Cholet to Niort,&rdquo; La Tribe said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The direction is rather that of Rochelle.&nbsp; God grant we
be bound thither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to Vrillac,&rdquo; the Countess cried, clasping her hands
in the darkness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can it be to Vrillac he is going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, let it be to Vrillac!&rdquo; she cried, a thrill in her
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;We should be safe there.&nbsp; And he would be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe?&rdquo; echoed a fourth and deeper voice.&nbsp; And out
of the darkness beside them loomed a tall figure.</p>
<p>The minister looked and leapt to his feet.&nbsp; Tignonville rose
more slowly.</p>
<p>The voice was Tavannes&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where am I to be
safe?&rdquo; he repeated slowly, a faint ring of saturnine amusement
in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Vrillac!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;In my house, Monsieur!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent a moment.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;Your house, Madame?&nbsp;
In which direction is it, from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Westwards,&rdquo; she answered impulsively, her voice quivering
with eagerness and emotion and hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Westwards, Monsieur&mdash;on
the sea.&nbsp; The causeway from the land is long, and ten can hold
it against ten hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Westwards?&nbsp; And how far westwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville answered for her; in his tone throbbed the same eagerness,
the same anxiety, which spoke in hers.&nbsp; Nor was Count Hannibal&rsquo;s
ear deaf to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through Challans,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;thirteen leagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Clisson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur le Comte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by Commequiers less,&rdquo; the Countess cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is a worse road,&rdquo; Tignonville answered quickly;
&ldquo;and longer in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we came&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At our leisure, Madame.&nbsp; The road is by Challans, if
we wish to be there quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Count Hannibal said.&nbsp; In the darkness it was
impossible to see his face or mark how he took it.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
being there, I have few men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have forty will come at call,&rdquo; she cried with pride.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A word to them, and in four hours or a little more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would outnumber mine by four to one,&rdquo; Count Hannibal
answered coldly, dryly, in a voice like ice-water flung in their faces.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you, Madame; I understand.&nbsp; To Vrillac is no long
ride; but we will not ride it at present.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned
sharply on his heel and strode from them.</p>
<p>He had not covered thirty paces before she overtook him in the middle
of a broad patch of moonlight, and touched his arm.&nbsp; He wheeled
swiftly, his hand halfway to his hilt.&nbsp; Then he saw who it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had forgotten, Madame.&nbsp;
You have come&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried passionately; and standing before him
she shook back the hood of her cloak that he might look into her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You owe me no blow to-day.&nbsp; You have paid me, Monsieur.&nbsp;
You have struck me already, and foully, like a coward.&nbsp; Do you
remember,&rdquo; she continued rapidly, &ldquo;the hour after our marriage,
and what you said to me?&nbsp; Do you remember what you told me?&nbsp;
And whom to trust and whom to suspect, where lay our interest and where
our foes&rsquo;?&nbsp; You trusted me then!&nbsp; What have I done that
you now dare&mdash;ay, dare, Monsieur,&rdquo; she repeated fearlessly,
her face pale and her eyes glittering with excitement, &ldquo;to insult
me?&nbsp; That you treat me as&mdash;Javette?&nbsp; That you deem me
capable of <i>that</i>?&nbsp; Of luring you into a trap, and in my own
house, or the house that was mine, of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treating me as I have treated others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said it!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; She could not herself
understand why his distrust had wounded her so sharply, so home, that
all fear of him was gone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have said it, and put that
between us which will not be removed.&nbsp; I could have forgiven blows,&rdquo;
she continued, breathless in her excitement, &ldquo;so you had thought
me what I am.&nbsp; But now you will do well to watch me!&nbsp; You
will do well to leave Vrillac on one side.&nbsp; For were you there,
and raised your hand against me&mdash;not that that touches me, but
it will do&mdash;and there are those, I tell you, would fling you from
the tower at my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed!&nbsp; And indeed, Monsieur!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face was in moonlight, his was in shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your new tone, Madame, is it?&rdquo; he said,
slowly and after a pregnant pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;The crossing of a river
has wrought so great a change in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And, despite herself, she flinched
before the grimness of his tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have yet to learn
one thing, however: that I do not change.&nbsp; That, north or south,
I am the same to those who are the same to me.&nbsp; That what I have
won on the one bank I will hold on the other, in the teeth of all, and
though God&rsquo;s Church be thundering on my heels!&nbsp; I go to Vrillac&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;go?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;to-morrow.&nbsp; And among
your own people I will see what language you will hold.&nbsp; While
you were in my power I spared you.&nbsp; Now that you are in your own
land, now that you lift your hand against me, I will show you of what
make I am.&nbsp; If blows will not tame you, I will try that will suit
you less.&nbsp; Ay, you wince, Madame!&nbsp; You had done well had you
thought twice before you threatened, and thrice before you took in hand
to scare Tavannes with a parcel of clowns and fisherfolk.&nbsp; To-morrow,
to Vrillac and your duty!&nbsp; And one word more, Madame,&rdquo; he
continued, turning back to her truculently when he had gone some paces
from her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I find you plotting with your lover by the
way I will hang not you, but him.&nbsp; I have spared him a score of
times; but I know him, and I do not trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me,&rdquo; she said, and with a white, set face she looked
at him in the moonlight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had you not better hang me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lest I do you an injury!&rdquo; she cried with passion; and
she raised her hand and pointed northward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lest I kill
you some night, Monsieur!&nbsp; I tell you, a thousand men on your heels
are less dangerous than the woman at your side&mdash;if she hate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; His hand flew to his hilt;
his dagger flashed out.&nbsp; But she did not move, did not flinch,
only she set her teeth; and her eyes, fascinated by the steel, grew
wider.</p>
<p>His hand sank slowly.&nbsp; He held the weapon to her, hilt foremost;
she took it mechanically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think yourself brave enough to kill me, do you?&rdquo;
he sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then take this, and strike, if you dare.&nbsp;
Take it&mdash;strike, Madame!&nbsp; It is sharp, and my arms are open.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he flung them wide, standing within a pace of her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here,
above the collar-bone, is the surest for a weak hand.&nbsp; What, afraid?&rdquo;
he continued, as, stiffly clutching the weapon which he had put into
her hand, she glared at him, trembling and astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;Afraid,
and a Vrillac!&nbsp; Afraid, and &rsquo;tis but one blow!&nbsp; See,
my arms are open.&nbsp; One blow home, and you will never lie in them.&nbsp;
Think of that.&nbsp; One blow home, and you may lie in his.&nbsp; Think
of that!&nbsp; Strike, then, Madame,&rdquo; he went on, piling taunt
on taunt, &ldquo;if you dare, and if you hate me.&nbsp; What, still
afraid!&nbsp; How shall I give you heart?&nbsp; Shall I strike you?&nbsp;
It will not be the first time by ten.&nbsp; I keep count, you see,&rdquo;
he continued mockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or shall I kiss you?&nbsp; Ay,
that may do.&nbsp; And it will not be against your will, either, for
you have that in your hand will save you in an instant.&nbsp; Even&rdquo;&mdash;he
drew a foot nearer&mdash;&ldquo;now!&nbsp; Even&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he stooped until his lips almost touched hers.</p>
<p>She sprang back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, do not!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, do not!&rdquo;&nbsp; And, dropping the dagger, she covered
her face with her hands, and burst into weeping.</p>
<p>He stooped coolly, and, after groping some time for the poniard,
drew it from the leaves among which it had fallen.&nbsp; He put it into
the sheath, and not until he had done that did he speak.&nbsp; Then
it was with a sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no need to fear overmuch,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are a poor hater, Madame.&nbsp; And poor haters make poor lovers.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis his loss!&nbsp; If you will not strike a blow for him, there
is but one thing left.&nbsp; Go, dream of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, he turned on his heel.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.&nbsp; THE AMBUSH.</h2>
<p>The start they made at daybreak was gloomy and ill-omened, through
one of those white mists which are blown from the Atlantic over the
flat lands of Western Poitou.&nbsp; The horses, looming gigantic through
the fog, winced as the cold harness was girded on them.&nbsp; The men
hurried to and fro with saddles on their heads, and stumbled over other
saddles, and swore savagely.&nbsp; The women turned mutinous and would
not rise; or, being dragged up by force, shrieked wild, unfitting words,
as they were driven to the horses.&nbsp; The Countess looked on and
listened, and shuddered, waiting for Carlat to set her on her horse.&nbsp;
She had gone during the last three weeks through much that was dreary,
much that was hopeless; but the chill discomfort of this forced start,
with tired horses and wailing women, would have darkened the prospect
of home had there been no fear or threat to cloud it.</p>
<p>He whose will compelled all stood a little apart and watched all,
silent and gloomy.&nbsp; When Badelon, after taking his orders and distributing
some slices of black bread to be eaten in the saddle, moved off at the
head of his troop, Count Hannibal remained behind, attended by Bigot
and the eight riders who had formed the rearguard so far.&nbsp; He had
not approached the Countess since rising, and she had been thankful
for it.&nbsp; But now, as she moved away, she looked back and saw him
still standing; she marked that he wore his corselet, and in one of
those revulsions of feeling&mdash;which outrun man&rsquo;s reason&mdash;she
who had tossed on her couch through half the night, in passionate revolt
against the fate before her, took fire at his neglect and his silence;
she resented on a sudden the distance he kept, and his scorn of her.&nbsp;
Her breast heaved, her colour came, involuntarily she checked her horse,
as if she would return to him, and speak to him.&nbsp; Then the Carlats
and the others closed up behind her, Badelon&rsquo;s monotonous &ldquo;Forward,
Madame, <i>en avant</i>!&rdquo; proclaimed the day&rsquo;s journey begun,
and she saw him no more.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the motionless figure, looming Homeric through the
fog, with gleams of wet light reflected from the steel about it, dwelt
long in her mind.&nbsp; The road which Badelon followed, slowly at first,
and with greater speed as the horses warmed to their work, and the women,
sore and battered resigned themselves to suffering, wound across a flat
expanse broken by a few hills.&nbsp; These were little more than mounds,
and for the most part were veiled from sight by the low-lying sea-mist,
through which gnarled and stunted oaks rose mysterious, to fade as strangely.&nbsp;
Weird trees they were, with branches unlike those of this world&rsquo;s
trees, rising in a grey land without horizon or limit, through which
our travellers moved, weary phantoms in a clinging nightmare.&nbsp;
At a walk, at a trot, more often at a jaded amble, they pushed on behind
Badelon&rsquo;s humped shoulders.&nbsp; Sometimes the fog hung so thick
about them that they saw only those who rose and fell in the saddles
immediately before them; sometimes the air cleared a little, the curtain
rolled up a space, and for a minute or two they discerned stretches
of unfertile fields, half-tilled and stony, or long tracts of gorse
and broom, with here and there a thicket of dwarf shrubs or a wood of
wind-swept pines.&nbsp; Some looked and saw these things; more rode
on sulky and unseeing, supporting impatiently the toils of a flight
from they knew not what.</p>
<p>To do Tignonville justice, he was not of these.&nbsp; On the contrary,
he seemed to be in a better temper on this day and, where so many took
things unheroically, he showed to advantage.&nbsp; Avoiding the Countess
and riding with Carlat, he talked and laughed with marked cheerfulness;
nor did he ever fail, when the mist rose, to note this or that landmark,
and confirm Badelon in the way he was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be at L&eacute;ge by noon!&rdquo; he cried more than
once, &ldquo;and if M. le Comte persists in his plan, may reach Vrillac
by late sunset.&nbsp; By way of Challans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And always Carlat answered, &ldquo;Ay, by Challans, Monsieur, so
be it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He proved, too, so far right in his prediction that noon saw them
drag, a weary train, into the hamlet of L&eacute;ge, where the road
from Nantes to Olonne runs southward over the level of Poitou.&nbsp;
An hour later Count Hannibal rode in with six of his eight men, and,
after a few minutes&rsquo; parley with Badelon, who was scanning the
horses, he called Carlat to him.&nbsp; The old man came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we reach Vrillac to-night?&rdquo; Count Hannibal asked
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Challans, my lord,&rdquo; the steward answered, &ldquo;I
think we can.&nbsp; We call it seven hours&rsquo; riding from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that route is the shortest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In time, M. le Comte, the road being better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal bent his brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the other way?&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is by Commequiers, my lord.&nbsp; It is shorter in distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By how much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two leagues.&nbsp; But there are fordings and a salt marsh;
and with Madame and the women&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he said slowly,
his eyes wandering to the grey misty landscape, against which the poor
hovels of the village stood out naked and comfortless.&nbsp; A low thicket
of oaks sheltered the place from south-westerly gales.&nbsp; On the
other three sides it lay open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Tavannes said curtly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ready
to start in ten minutes.&nbsp; You will guide us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the ten minutes had elapsed and the party were ready to
start, to the astonishment of all the steward was not to be found.&nbsp;
To peremptory calls for him no answer came; and a hurried search through
the hamlet proved equally fruitless.&nbsp; The only person who had seen
him since his interview with Tavannes turned out to be M. de Tignonville;
and he had seen him mount his horse five minutes before, and move off&mdash;as
he believed&mdash;by the Challans road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, M. le Comte,&rdquo; Tignonville answered, shading his
eyes and gazing in the direction of the fringe of trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
did not see him take the road, but he was beside the north end of the
wood when I saw him last.&nbsp; Thereabouts!&rdquo; and he pointed to
a place where the Challans road wound round the flank of the wood.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When we are beyond that point, I think we shall see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal growled a word in his beard, and, turning in his saddle,
looked back the way he had come.&nbsp; Half a mile away, two or three
dots could be seen approaching across the plain.&nbsp; He turned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the road?&rdquo; he said, curtly addressing the young
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&nbsp; As well as Carlat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then lead the way, Monsieur, with Badelon.&nbsp; And spare
neither whip nor spur.&nbsp; There will be need of both, if we would
lie warm to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tignonville nodded assent and, wheeling his horse, rode to the head
of the party, a faint smile playing about his mouth.&nbsp; A moment,
and the main body moved off behind him, leaving Count Hannibal and six
men to cover the rear.&nbsp; The mist, which at noon had risen for an
hour or two, was closing down again, and they had no sooner passed clear
of the wood than the trees faded out of sight behind them.&nbsp; It
was not wonderful that they could not see Carlat.&nbsp; Objects a hundred
paces from them were completely hidden.</p>
<p>Trot, trot!&nbsp; Trot, trot! through a grey world so featureless,
so unreal that the riders, now dozing in the saddle, and now awaking,
seemed to themselves to stand still, as in a nightmare.&nbsp; A trot
and then a walk, and then a trot again; and all a dozen times repeated,
while the women bumped along in their wretched saddles, and the horses
stumbled, and the men swore at them.</p>
<p>Ha!&nbsp; La Garnache at last, and a sharp turn southward to Challans.&nbsp;
The Countess raised her head, and began to look about her.&nbsp; There,
should be a church, she knew; and there, the old ruined tower built
by wizards, or the Carthaginians, so old tradition ran; and there, to
the westward, the great salt marshes towards Noirmoutier.&nbsp; The
mist hid all, but the knowledge that they were there set her heart beating,
brought tears to her eyes, and lightened the long road to Challans.</p>
<p>At Challans they halted half an hour, and washed out the horses&rsquo;
mouths with water and a little <i>guignolet</i>&mdash;the spirit of
the country.&nbsp; A dose of the cordial was administered to the women;
and a little after seven they began the last stage of the journey, through
a landscape which even the mist could not veil from the eyes of love.&nbsp;
There rose the windmill of Soullans!&nbsp; There the old dolmen, beneath
which the grey wolf that ate the two children of Tornic had its lair.&nbsp;
For a mile back they had been treading my lady&rsquo;s land; they had
only two more leagues to ride, and one of those was crumbling under
each dogged footfall.&nbsp; The salt flavour, which is new life to the
shore-born, was in the fleecy reek which floated by them, now thinner,
now more opaque; and almost they could hear the dull thunder of the
Biscay waves falling on the rocks.</p>
<p>Tignonville looked back at her and smiled.&nbsp; She caught the look;
she fancied that she understood it and his thoughts.&nbsp; But her own
eyes were moist at the moment with tears, and what his said, and what
there was of strangeness in his glance, half-warning, half-exultant,
escaped her.&nbsp; For there, not a mile before them, where the low
hills about the fishing village began to rise from the dull inland level&mdash;hills
green on the land side, bare and scarped towards the sea and the island&mdash;she
espied the wayside chapel at which the nurse of her early childhood
had told her beads.&nbsp; Where it stood, the road from Commequiers
and the road she travelled became one: a short mile thence, after winding
among the hillocks, it ran down to the beach and the causeway&mdash;and
to her home.</p>
<p>At the sight she bethought herself of Carlat, and calling to M. de
Tignonville, she asked him what he thought of the steward&rsquo;s continued
absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have outpaced us!&rdquo; he answered, with an odd
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he must have ridden hard to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reined back to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say nothing!&rdquo; he muttered
under his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;But look ahead, Madame, and see if we
are expected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expected?&nbsp; How can we be expected?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
The colour rushed into her face.</p>
<p>He put his finger to his lip, and looked warningly at Badelon&rsquo;s
humped shoulders, jogging up and down in front of them.&nbsp; Then,
stooping towards her, in a lower tone, &ldquo;If Carlat has arrived
before us, he will have told them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have told them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came by the other road, and it is quicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed at him in astonishment, her lips parted; and slowly she
understood, and her eyes grew hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you say it was longer.&nbsp;
Had we been overtaken, Monsieur, we had had you to thank for it, it
seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bit his lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we have not been overtaken,&rdquo;
he rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the contrary, you have me to thank for
something quite different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As unwelcome, perhaps!&rdquo; she retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; she repeated, refusing to lower her voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak, Monsieur, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had never seen
her look at him in that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the fact,&rdquo; he answered, stung by her look and tone,
&ldquo;that when you arrive you will find yourself mistress in your
own house!&nbsp; Is that nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have called in my people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlat has done so, or should have,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Henceforth,&rdquo; he continued, a ring of exultation in his
voice, &ldquo;it will go hard with M. le Comte, if he does not treat
you better than he has treated you hitherto.&nbsp; That is all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that it will go hard with him in any case?&rdquo;
she cried, her bosom rising and falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, Madame&mdash;But there they are!&nbsp; Good Carlat!&nbsp;
Brave Carlat!&nbsp; He has done well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, there they are!&nbsp; And you are mistress in your own
land!&nbsp; At last you are mistress, and you have me to thank for it!&nbsp;
See!&rdquo;&nbsp; And heedless in his exultation whether Badelon understood
or not, he pointed to a place before them where the road wound between
two low hills.&nbsp; Over the green shoulder of one of these, a dozen
bright points caught and reflected the last evening light; while as
he spoke a man rose to his feet on the hillside above, and began to
make signs to persons below.&nbsp; A pennon, too, showed an instant
over the shoulder, fluttered, and was gone.</p>
<p>Badelon looked as they looked.&nbsp; The next instant he uttered
a low oath, and dragged his horse across the front of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre!&rdquo; he cried to the man on his left, &ldquo;ride
for your life!&nbsp; To my lord, and tell him we are ambushed!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And as the trained soldier wheeled about and spurred away, the sacker
of Rome turned a dark scowling face on Tignonville.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
this be your work,&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;we shall thank you for it
in hell!&nbsp; For it is where most of us will lie to-night!&nbsp; They
are Montsoreau&rsquo;s spears, and they have those with them are worse
to deal with than themselves!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then in a different tone,
and throwing off all disguise, &ldquo;Men to the front!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you, Madame, to the rear quickly, and the women with you!&nbsp;
Now, men, forward, and draw!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; They
are coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an instant of confusion, disorder, panic; horses jostling
one another, women screaming and clutching at men, men shaking them
off and forcing their way to the van.&nbsp; Fortunately the enemy did
not fall on at once, as Badelon expected, but after showing themselves
in the mouth of the valley, at a distance of three hundred paces, hung
for some reason irresolute.&nbsp; This gave Badelon time to array his
seven swords in front; but real resistance was out of the question,
as he knew.&nbsp; And to none seemed less in question than to Tignonville.</p>
<p>When the truth, and what he had done, broke on the young man, he
sat a moment motionless with horror.&nbsp; It was only when Badelon
had twice summoned him with opprobrious words that he awoke to the relief
of action.&nbsp; Even after that he hung an instant trying to meet the
Countess&rsquo;s eyes, despair in his own; but it was not to be.&nbsp;
She had turned her head, and was looking back, as if thence only and
not from him could help come.&nbsp; It was not to him she turned; and
he saw it, and the justice of it.&nbsp; And silent, grim, more formidable
even than old Badelon, the veteran fighter, who knew all the tricks
and shifts of the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, he spurred to the flank
of the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, steady!&rdquo; Badelon cried again, seeing that the enemy
were beginning to move.&nbsp; &ldquo;Steady!&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Thank God,
my lord!&nbsp; My lord is coming!&nbsp; Stand!&nbsp; Stand!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The distant sound of galloping hoofs had reached his ear in the nick
of time.&nbsp; He stood in his stirrups and looked back.&nbsp; Yes,
Count Hannibal was coming, riding a dozen paces in front of his men.&nbsp;
The odds were still desperate&mdash;for he brought but six&mdash;the
enemy were still three to one.&nbsp; But the thunder of his hoofs as
he came up checked for a moment the enemy&rsquo;s onset; and before
Montsoreau&rsquo;s people got started again Count Hannibal had ridden
up abreast of the women, and the Countess, looking at him, knew that,
desperate as was their strait, she had not looked behind in vain.&nbsp;
The glow of battle, the stress of the moment, had displaced the cloud
from his face; the joy of the born fighter lightened in his eye.&nbsp;
His voice rang clear and loud above the press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badelon! wait you and two with Madame!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Follow at fifty paces&rsquo; distance, and, when we have broken
them, ride through!&nbsp; The others with me!&nbsp; Now forward, men,
and show your teeth!&nbsp; A Tavannes!&nbsp; A Tavannes!&nbsp; A Tavannes!&nbsp;
We carry it yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he dashed forward, leading them on, leaving the women behind;
and down the sward to meet him, thundering in double line, came Montsoreau&rsquo;s
men-at-arms, and with the men-at-arms, a dozen pale, fierce-eyed men
in the Church&rsquo;s black, yelling the Church&rsquo;s curses.&nbsp;
Madame&rsquo;s heart grew sick as she heard, as she waited, as she judged
him by the fast-failing light a horse&rsquo;s length before his men&mdash;with
only Tignonville beside him.</p>
<p>She held her breath&mdash;would the shock never come?&nbsp; If Badelon
had not seized her rein and forced her forward, she would not have moved.&nbsp;
And then, even as she moved, they met!&nbsp; With yells and wild cries
and a mare&rsquo;s savage scream, the two bands crashed together in
a huddle of fallen or rearing horses, of flickering weapons, of thrusting
men, of grapples hand-to-hand.&nbsp; What happened, what was happening
to any one, who it was fell, stabbed through and through by four, or
who were those who still fought single combats, twisting round one another&rsquo;s
horses, those on her right and on her left, she could not tell.&nbsp;
For Badelon dragged her on with whip and spur, and two horsemen&mdash;who
obscured her view&mdash;galloped in front of her, and rode down bodily
the only man who undertook to bar her passage.&nbsp; She had a glimpse
of that man&rsquo;s face, as his horse, struck in the act of turning,
fell sideways on him; and she knew it, in its agony of terror, though
she had seen it but once.&nbsp; It was the face of the man whose eyes
had sought hers from the steps of the church in Angers; the lean man
in black, who had turned soldier of the Church&mdash;to his misfortune.</p>
<p>Through?&nbsp; Yes, through, the way was clear before them!&nbsp;
The fight with its screams and curses died away behind them.&nbsp; The
horses swayed and all but sank under them.&nbsp; But Badelon knew it
no time for mercy; iron-shod hoofs rang on the road behind, and at any
moment the pursuers might be on their heels.&nbsp; He flogged on until
the cots of the hamlet appeared on either side of the way; on, until
the road forked and the Countess with strange readiness cried &ldquo;The
left!&rdquo;&mdash;on, until the beach appeared below them at the foot
of a sharp pitch, and beyond the beach the slow heaving grey of the
ocean.</p>
<p>The tide was high.&nbsp; The causeway ran through it, a mere thread
lipped by the darkling waves, and at the sight a grunt of relief broke
from Badelon.&nbsp; For at the end of the causeway, black against the
western sky, rose the gateway and towers of Vrillac; and he saw that,
as the Countess had said, it was a place ten men could hold against
ten hundred!</p>
<p>They stumbled down the beach, reached the causeway and trotted along
it; more slowly now, and looking back.&nbsp; The other women had followed
by hook or by crook, some crying hysterically, yet clinging to their
horses and even urging them; and in a medley, the causeway clear behind
them and no one following, they reached the drawbridge, and passed under
the arch of the gate beyond.</p>
<p>There friendly hands, Carlat&rsquo;s foremost, welcomed them and
aided them to alight, and the Countess saw, as in a dream, the familiar
scene, all unfamiliar: the gate, where she had played, a child, aglow
with lantern-light and arms.&nbsp; Men, whose rugged faces she had known
in infancy, stood at the drawbridge chains and at the winches.&nbsp;
Others blew matches and handled primers, while old servants crowded
round her, and women looked at her, scared and weeping.&nbsp; She saw
it all at a glance&mdash;the lights, the black shadows, the sudden glow
of a match on the groining of the arch above.&nbsp; She saw it, and
turning swiftly, looked back the way she had come; along the dusky causeway
to the low, dark shore, which night was stealing quickly from their
eyes.&nbsp; She clasped her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Badelon?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is
he?&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men who had ridden before her answered that he had turned
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turned back!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; And then, shading
her eyes, &ldquo;Who is coming?&rdquo; she asked, her voice insistent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is some one coming.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two were coming out of the gloom, travelling slowly and painfully
along the causeway.&nbsp; One was La Tribe, limping; the other a rider,
slashed across the forehead, and sobbing curses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more!&rdquo; she muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are there no more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister shook his head.&nbsp; The rider wiped the blood from
his eyes, and turned up his face that he might see the better.&nbsp;
But he seemed to be dazed, and only babbled strange words in a strange
<i>patois</i>.</p>
<p>She stamped her foot in passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;More lights!&rdquo;
she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lights!&nbsp; How can they find their way?&nbsp;
And let six men go down the <i>digue</i>, and meet them.&nbsp; Will
you let them be butchered between the shore and this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Carlat, who had not been able to collect more than a dozen men,
shook his head; and before she could repeat the order, sounds of battle,
shrill, faint, like cries of hungry seagulls, pierced the darkness which
shrouded the farther end of the causeway.&nbsp; The women shrank inward
over the threshold, while Carlat cried to the men at the chains to be
ready, and to some who stood at loopholes above, to blow up their matches
and let fly at his word.&nbsp; And then they all waited, the Countess
foremost, peering eagerly into the growing darkness.&nbsp; They could
see nothing.</p>
<p>A distant scuffle, an oath, a cry, silence!&nbsp; The same, a little
nearer, a little louder, followed this time, not by silence, but by
the slow tread of a limping horse.&nbsp; Again a rush of feet, the clash
of steel, a scream, a laugh, all weird and unreal, issuing from the
night; then out of the darkness into the light, stepping slowly with
hanging head, moved a horse, bearing on its back a man&mdash;or was
it a man?&mdash;bending low in the saddle, his feet swinging loose.&nbsp;
For an instant the horse and the man seemed to be alone, a ghostly pair;
then at their heels came into view two figures, skirmishing this way
and that; and now coming nearer, and now darting back into the gloom.&nbsp;
One, a squat figure, stooping low, wielded a sword with two hands; the
other covered him with a half-pike.&nbsp; And then beyond these&mdash;abruptly
as it seemed&mdash;the night gave up to sight a swarm of dark figures
pressing on them and after them, driving them before them.</p>
<p>Carlat had an inspiration.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he cried; and
four arquebuses poured a score of slugs into the knot of pursuers.&nbsp;
A man fell, another shrieked and stumbled, the rest gave back.&nbsp;
Only the horse came on spectrally, with hanging head and shining eyeballs,
until a man ran out and seized its head, and dragged it, more by his
strength than its own, over the drawbridge.&nbsp; After it Badelon,
with a gaping wound in his knee, and Bigot, bleeding from a dozen hurts,
walked over the bridge, and stood on either side of the saddle, smiling
foolishly at the man on the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave me!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He made a feeble movement with his hand, as if it held a weapon; then
his head sank lower.&nbsp; It was Count Hannibal.&nbsp; His thigh was
broken, and there was a lance-head in his arm.&nbsp; The Countess looked
at him, then beyond him, past him into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there no more?&rdquo; she whispered tremulously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No more?&nbsp; Tignonville&mdash;my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Badelon shook his head.&nbsp; The Countess covered her face and wept.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.&nbsp; WHICH WILL YOU, MADAME?</h2>
<p>It was in the grey dawning of the next day, at the hour before the
sun rose, that word of M. de Tignonville&rsquo;s fate came to them in
the castle.&nbsp; The fog which had masked the van and coming of night
hung thick on its retreating skirts, and only reluctantly and little
by little gave up to sight and daylight a certain thing which night
had left at the end of the causeway.&nbsp; The first man to see it was
Carlat, from the roof of the gateway; and he rubbed eyes weary with
watching, and peered anew at it through the mist, fancying himself back
in the Place Ste.-Croix at Angers, supposing for a wild moment the journey
a dream, and the return a nightmare.&nbsp; But rub as he might, and
stare as he might, the ugly outlines of the thing he had seen persisted&mdash;nay,
grew sharper as the haze began to lift from the grey, slow-heaving floor
of sea.&nbsp; He called another man and bade him look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;you see,
there?&nbsp; Below the village?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a gibbet,&rdquo; the man answered, with a foolish
laugh; they had watched all night.&nbsp; &ldquo;God keep us from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gibbet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it for?&nbsp; What is it doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is there to hang those they have taken, very like,&rdquo;
the man answered, stupidly practical.&nbsp; And then other men came
up, and stared at it and growled in their beards.&nbsp; Presently there
were eight or ten on the roof of the gateway looking towards the land
and discussing the thing; and by-and-by a man was descried approaching
along the causeway with a white flag in his hand.</p>
<p>At that Carlat bade one fetch the minister.&nbsp; &ldquo;He understands
things,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and I misdoubt this.&nbsp; And see,&rdquo;
he cried after the messenger, &ldquo;that no word of it come to Mademoiselle!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Instinctively in the maiden home he reverted to the maiden title.</p>
<p>The messenger went, and came again bringing La Tribe, whose head
rose above the staircase at the moment the envoy below came to a halt
before the gate.&nbsp; Carlat signed to the minister to come forward;
and La Tribe, after sniffing the salt air, and glancing at the long,
low, misty shore and the stiff ugly shape which stood at the end of
the causeway, looked down and met the envoy&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; For
a moment no one spoke.&nbsp; Only the men who had remained on the gateway,
and had watched the stranger&rsquo;s coming, breathed hard.</p>
<p>At last, &ldquo;I bear a message,&rdquo; the man announced loudly
and clearly, &ldquo;for the lady of Vrillac.&nbsp; Is she present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give your message!&rdquo; La Tribe replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for her ears only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to enter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; The man answered so hurriedly that more than
one smiled.&nbsp; He had the bearing of a lay clerk of some precinct,
a verger or sacristan; and after a fashion the dress of one also, for
he was in dusty black and wore no sword, though he was girded with a
belt.&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;but if Madame will
come to the gate, and speak to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame has other fish to fry,&rdquo; Carlat blurted out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think that she has naught to do but listen to messages
from a gang of bandits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she does not listen she will repent it all her life!&rdquo;
the fellow answered hardily.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is part of my message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause while La Tribe considered the matter.&nbsp; In
the end, &ldquo;From whom do you come?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of Saumur,&rdquo;
the envoy answered glibly, &ldquo;and from my Lord Bishop of Angers,
him assisting by his Vicar; and from others gathered lawfully, who will
as lawfully depart if their terms are accepted.&nbsp; Also from M. de
Tignonville, a gentleman, I am told, of these parts, now in their hands
and adjudged to die at sunset this day if the terms I bring be not accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence on the gate.&nbsp; The men looked down fixedly;
not a feature of one of them moved, for no one was surprised.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore is he to die?&rdquo; La Tribe asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For good cause shown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a Huguenot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the terms?&rdquo; Carlat muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, the terms!&rdquo; La Tribe repeated, nodding afresh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are for Madame&rsquo;s ear only,&rdquo; the messenger
made answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they will not reach it!&rdquo; Carlat broke forth in
wrath.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much for that!&nbsp; And for yourself, see you
go quickly before we make a target of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I go,&rdquo; the envoy answered sullenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; La Tribe cried, gripping Carlat&rsquo;s shoulder
to quiet him.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what?&nbsp; Say what you have to say,
man!&nbsp; Speak out, and have done with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say it to her and to no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will not say it!&rdquo; Carlat cried again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For you will not see her.&nbsp; So you may go.&nbsp; And the
black fever in your vitals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, go!&rdquo; La Tribe added more quietly.</p>
<p>The man turned away with a shrug of the shoulders, and moved off
a dozen paces, watched by all on the gate with the same fixed attention.&nbsp;
But presently he paused; he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, looking up with an ill grace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will do my office here, if I cannot come to her.&nbsp; But
I hold also a letter from M. de Tignonville, and that I can deliver
to no other hands than hers!&rdquo;&nbsp; He held it up as he spoke,
a thin scrap of greyish paper, the fly-leaf of a missal perhaps.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and take notice!&nbsp; If she
does not get this, and learns when it is too late that it was offered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The terms,&rdquo; Carlat growled impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
terms!&nbsp; Come to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have them?&rdquo; the man answered, nervously passing
his tongue over his lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not let me see her,
or speak to her privately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hear them.&nbsp; His Excellency is informed that one
Hannibal de Tavannes, guilty of the detestable crime of sacrilege and
of other gross crimes, has taken refuge here.&nbsp; He requires that
the said Hannibal de Tavannes be handed to him for punishment, and,
this being done before sunset this evening, he will yield to you free
and uninjured the said M. de Tignonville, and will retire from the lands
of Vrillac.&nbsp; But if you refuse&rdquo;&mdash;the man passed his
eye along the line of attentive faces which fringed the battlement&mdash;&ldquo;he
will at sunset hang the said Tignonville on the gallows raised for Tavannes,
and will harry the demesne of Vrillac to its farthest border!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence on the gate.&nbsp; Some, their gaze still
fixed on him, moved their lips as if they chewed.&nbsp; Others looked
aside, met their fellows&rsquo; eyes in a pregnant glance, and slowly
returned to him.&nbsp; But no one spoke.&nbsp; At his back the flush
of dawn was flooding the east, and spreading and waxing brighter.&nbsp;
The air was growing warm; the shore below, from grey, was turning green.</p>
<p>In a minute or two the sun, whose glowing marge already peeped above
the low hills of France, would top the horizon.</p>
<p>The man, getting no answer, shifted his feet uneasily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;what answer am I to take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no one moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my part.&nbsp; Will no one give her the letter?&rdquo;
he cried.&nbsp; And he held it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me my answer, for
I am going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the letter!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words came from the rear
of the group in a voice that startled all.&nbsp; They turned, as though
some one had struck them, and saw the Countess standing beside the hood
which covered the stairs.&nbsp; They guessed that she had heard all
or nearly all; but the glory of the sunrise, shining full on her at
that moment, lent a false warmth to her face, and life to eyes woefully
and tragically set.&nbsp; It was not easy to say whether she had heard
or not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take the letter,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>Carlat looked helplessly over the parapet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cast a glance at La Tribe, but he got none in return, and he was
preparing to do her bidding when a cry of dismay broke from those who
still had their eyes bent downwards.&nbsp; The messenger, waving the
letter in a last appeal, had held it too loosely; a light air, as treacherous,
as unexpected, had snatched it from his hand, and bore it&mdash;even
as the Countess, drawn by the cry, sprang to the parapet&mdash;fifty
paces from him.&nbsp; A moment it floated in the air, eddying, rising,
falling; then, light as thistledown, it touched the water and began
to sink.</p>
<p>The messenger uttered frantic lamentations, and stamped the causeway
in his rage.&nbsp; The Countess only looked, and looked, until the rippling
crest of a baby wave broke over the tiny venture, and with its freight
of tidings it sank from sight.</p>
<p>The man, silent now, stared a moment, then shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis fortunate it was his,&rdquo; he cried brutally,
&ldquo;and not His Excellency&rsquo;s, or my back had suffered!&nbsp;
And now,&rdquo; he added impatiently, &ldquo;by your leave, what answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What answer?&nbsp; Ah, God, what answer?&nbsp; The men who leant
on the parapet, rude and coarse as they were, felt the tragedy of the
question and the dilemma, guessed what they meant to her, and looked
everywhere save at her.</p>
<p>What answer?&nbsp; Which of the two was to live?&nbsp; Which die&mdash;shamefully?&nbsp;
Which?&nbsp; Which?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him&mdash;to come back&mdash;an hour before sunset,&rdquo;
she muttered.</p>
<p>They told him and he went; and one by one the men began to go too,
and stole from the roof, leaving her standing alone, her face to the
shore, her hands resting on the parapet.&nbsp; The light breeze which
blew off the land stirred loose ringlets of her hair, and flattened
the thin robe against her sunlit figure.&nbsp; So had she stood a thousand
times in old days, in her youth, in her maidenhood.&nbsp; So in her
father&rsquo;s time had she stood to see her lover come riding along
the sands to woo her!&nbsp; So had she stood to welcome him on the eve
of that fatal journey to Paris!&nbsp; Thence had others watched her
go with him.&nbsp; The men remembered&mdash;remembered all; and one
by one they stole shamefacedly away, fearing lest she should speak or
turn tragic eyes on them.</p>
<p>True, in their pity for her was no doubt of the end, or thought of
the victim who must suffer&mdash;of Tavannes.&nbsp; They, of Poitou,
who had not been with him, knew nothing of him; they cared as little.&nbsp;
He was a northern man, a stranger, a man of the sword, who had seized
her&mdash;so they heard&mdash;by the sword.&nbsp; But they saw that
the burden of choice was laid on her; there, in her sight and in theirs,
rose the gibbet; and, clowns as they were, they discerned the tragedy
of her <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, play it as she might, and though her act gave
life to her lover.</p>
<p>When all had retired save three or four, she turned and saw these
gathered at the head of the stairs in a ring about Carlat, who was addressing
them in a low eager voice.&nbsp; She could not catch a syllable, but
a look hard and almost cruel flashed into her eyes as she gazed; and
raising her voice she called the steward to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bridge is up,&rdquo; she said, her tone hard, &ldquo;but
the gates?&nbsp; Are they locked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wicket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the wicket.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Carlat looked another
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go, lock it, and bring the keys to me!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or stay!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice grew harder, her eyes spiteful
as a cat&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay, and be warned that you play me
no tricks!&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; Or old
as you are, and long as you have served us, I will have you thrown from
this tower, with as little pity as Isabeau flung her gallants to the
fishes.&nbsp; I am still mistress here, never more mistress than this
day.&nbsp; Woe to you if you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He blenched and cringed before her, muttering incoherently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I read you!&nbsp; And now
the keys.&nbsp; Go, bring them to me!&nbsp; And if by chance I find
the wicket unlocked when I come down, pray, Carlat, pray!&nbsp; For
you will have need of prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slunk away, the men with him; and she fell to pacing the roof
feverishly.&nbsp; Now and then she extended her arms, and low cries
broke from her, as from a dumb creature in pain.&nbsp; Wherever she
looked, old memories rose up to torment her and redouble her misery.&nbsp;
A thing she could have borne in the outer world, a thing which might
have seemed tolerable in the reeking air of Paris or in the gloomy streets
of Angers wore here its most appalling aspect.&nbsp; Henceforth, whatever
choice she made, this home, where even in those troublous times she
had known naught but peace, must bear a damning stain!&nbsp; Henceforth
this day and this hour must come between her and happiness, must brand
her brow, and fix her with a deed of which men and women would tell
while she lived!&nbsp; Oh, God&mdash;pray?&nbsp; Who said, pray?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo;&nbsp; And La Tribe with tears in his eyes held out
the keys to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I, Madame,&rdquo; he continued solemnly,
his voice broken with emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;For in man is no help.&nbsp;
The strongest man, he who rode yesterday a master of men, a very man
of war in his pride and his valour&mdash;see him, now, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried, sharp pain in her voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stopped him with her hand,
her face averted.&nbsp; After an interval, &ldquo;You come from him?&rdquo;
she muttered faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;hurt to death, think you?&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke
low, and kept her face hidden from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no!&rdquo; he answered, speaking the thought in his
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;The men who are with him seem confident of his recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badelon has had experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no.&nbsp; Do they know of this?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of this!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she pointed with a gesture of loathing
to the black gibbet on the farther strand.</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
And after a moment, &ldquo;God help you!&rdquo; he added fervently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God help and guide you, Madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned on him suddenly, fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that all you
can do?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that all the help you can
give?&nbsp; You are a man.&nbsp; Go down, lead them out; drive off these
cowards who drain our life&rsquo;s blood, who trade on a woman&rsquo;s
heart!&nbsp; On them!&nbsp; Do something, anything, rather than lie
in safety here&mdash;here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister shook his head sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, Madame!&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;to sally were to waste life.&nbsp; They outnumber us
three to one.&nbsp; If Count Hannibal could do no more than break through
last night, with scarce a man unwounded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had the women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have not him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not have left us!&rdquo; she cried hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had they taken me, do you think he would have lain behind
walls?&nbsp; Or skulked in safety here, while&mdash;while&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her voice failed her.</p>
<p>He shook his head despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all you can do?&rdquo; she cried, and turned from
him, and to him again, extending her arms, in bitter scorn.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
you will do?&nbsp; Do you forget that twice he spared your life?&nbsp;
That in Paris once, and once in Angers, he held his hand?&nbsp; That
always, whether he stood or whether he fled, he held himself between
us and harm?&nbsp; Ay, always?&nbsp; And who will now raise a hand for
him?&nbsp; Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; Had he died in the field,&rdquo; she
continued, her voice shaking with grief, her hands beating the parapet&mdash;for
she had turned from him&mdash;&ldquo;had he fallen where he rode last
night, in the front, with his face to the foe, I had viewed him tearless,
I had deemed him happy!&nbsp; I had prayed dry-eyed for him who&mdash;who
spared me all these days and weeks!&nbsp; Whom I robbed and he forgave
me!&nbsp; Whom I tempted, and he forbore me!&nbsp; Ay, and who spared
not once or twice him for whom he must now&mdash;he must now&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
And unable to finish the sentence she beat her hands again and passionately
on the stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows, Madame,&rdquo; the minister cried vehemently,
&ldquo;Heaven knows, I would advise you if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he wear his corselet?&rdquo; she wailed, as if she
had not heard him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was there no spear could reach his breast,
that he must come to this?&nbsp; No foe so gentle he would spare him
this?&nbsp; Or why did <i>he</i> not die with me in Paris when we waited?&nbsp;
In another minute death might have come and saved us this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the tears running down his face he tried to comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man that is a shadow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;passeth away&mdash;what
matter how?&nbsp; A little while, a very little while, and we shall
pass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his curse upon us!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; And, shuddering,
she pressed her hands to her eyes to shut out the sight her fancy pictured.</p>
<p>He left her for a while, hoping that in solitude she might regain
control of herself.&nbsp; When he returned he found her seated, and
outwardly more composed; her arms resting on the parapet-wall, her eyes
bent steadily on the long stretch of hard sand which ran northward from
the village.&nbsp; By that route her lover had many a time come to her;
there she had ridden with him in the early days; and that way they had
started for Paris on such a morning and at such an hour as this, with
sunshine about them, and larks singing hope above the sand-dunes, and
with wavelets creaming to the horses&rsquo; hoofs!</p>
<p>Of all which La Tribe, a stranger, knew nothing.&nbsp; The rapt gaze,
the unchanging attitude only confirmed his opinion of the course she
would adopt.&nbsp; He was thankful to find her more composed; and in
fear of such a scene as had already passed between them, he stole away
again.&nbsp; He returned by-and-by, but with the greatest reluctance,
and only because Carlat&rsquo;s urgency would take no refusal.</p>
<p>He came this time to crave the key of the wicket, explaining that&mdash;rather
to satisfy his own conscience and the men than with any hope of success&mdash;he
proposed to go halfway along the causeway, and thence by signs invite
a conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just possible,&rdquo; he added, hesitating&mdash;he
feared nothing so much as to raise hopes in her&mdash;&ldquo;that by
the offer of a money ransom, Madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, without turning her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Offer
what you please.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;have a
care of them!&nbsp; Montsoreau is very like Montereau!&nbsp; Beware
of the bridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went and came again in half an hour.&nbsp; Then, indeed, though
she had spoken as if hope was dead in her, she was on her feet at the
first sound of his tread on the stairs; her parted lips and her white
face questioned him.&nbsp; He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a priest,&rdquo; he said in broken tones, &ldquo;with
them, whom God will judge.&nbsp; It is his plan, and he is without mercy
or pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bring nothing from&mdash;him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not suffer him to write again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.&nbsp; AGAINST THE WALL.</h2>
<p>In a room beside the gateway, into which, as the nearest and most
convenient place, Count Hannibal had been carried from his saddle, a
man sat sideways in the narrow embrasure of a loophole, to which his
eyes seemed glued.&nbsp; The room, which formed part of the oldest block
of the ch&acirc;teau, and was ordinarily the quarters of the Carlats,
possessed two other windows, deep-set indeed, yet superior to that through
which Bigot&mdash;for he it was&mdash;peered so persistently.&nbsp;
But the larger windows looked southwards, across the bay&mdash;at this
moment the noon-high sun was pouring his radiance through them; while
the object which held Bigot&rsquo;s gaze and fixed him to his irksome
seat, lay elsewhere.&nbsp; The loophole commanded the causeway leading
shorewards; through it the Norman could see who came and went, and even
the cross-beam of the ugly object which rose where the causeway touched
the land.</p>
<p>On a flat truckle-bed behind the door lay Count Hannibal, his injured
leg protected from the coverlid by a kind of cage.&nbsp; His eyes were
bright with fever, and his untended beard and straggling hair heightened
the wildness of his aspect.&nbsp; But he was in possession of his senses;
and as his gaze passed from Bigot at the window to the old Free Companion,
who sat on a stool beside him, engaged in shaping a piece of wood into
a splint, an expression almost soft crept into his harsh face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; And his voice, though changed,
had not lost all its strength and harshness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did the Constable
need a splint when you laid him under the tower at Gaeta?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man lifted his eyes from his task, and glanced through the
nearest window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is long from noon to night,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;and
far from cup to lip, my lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be if I had two legs,&rdquo; Tavannes answered, with
a grimace, half-snarl, half-smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;As it is&mdash;where
is that dagger?&nbsp; It leaves me every minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had slipped from the coverlid to the ground.&nbsp; Badelon took
it up, and set it on the bed within reach of his master&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Bigot swore fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be farther still,&rdquo;
he growled, &ldquo;if you would be guided by me, my lord.&nbsp; Give
me leave to bar the door, and &rsquo;twill be long before these fisher
clowns force it.&nbsp; Badelon and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being in your full strength,&rdquo; Count Hannibal murmured
cynically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could hold it.&nbsp; We have strength enough for that,&rdquo;
the Norman boasted, though his livid face and his bandages gave the
lie to his words.&nbsp; He could not move without pain; and for Badelon,
his knee was as big as two with plaisters of his own placing.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal stared at the ceiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You could not
strike two blows!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me!&nbsp;
And Badelon cannot walk two yards!&nbsp; Fine fighters!&rdquo; he continued
with bitterness, not all bitter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fine bars &rsquo;twixt
a man and death!&nbsp; No, it is time to turn the face to the wall.&nbsp;
And, since go I must, it shall not be said Count Hannibal dared not
go alone!&nbsp; Besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigot stopped him with an oath that was in part a cry of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D---n her!&rdquo; he exclaimed in fury, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis
she is that <i>besides</i>!&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis she has
been our ruin from the day we saw her first, ay, to this day!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis she has bewitched you until your blood, my lord, has turned
to water.&nbsp; Or you would never, to save the hand that betrayed us,
never to save a man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Count Hannibal cried, in a terrible voice.&nbsp;
And rising on his elbow, he poised the dagger as if he would hurl it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Silence, or I will spit you like the vermin you are!&nbsp; Silence,
and listen!&nbsp; And you, old ban-dog, listen too, for I know you obstinate!&nbsp;
It is not to save him.&nbsp; It is because I will die as I have lived,
fearing nothing and asking nothing!&nbsp; It were easy to bar the door
as you would have me, and die in the corner here like a wolf at bay,
biting to the last.&nbsp; That were easy, old wolf-hound!&nbsp; Pleasant
and good sport!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay!&nbsp; That were a death!&rdquo; the veteran cried, his
eyes brightening.&nbsp; &ldquo;So I would fain die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I!&rdquo; Count Hannibal returned, showing his teeth in
a grim smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I too!&nbsp; Yet I will not!&nbsp; I will
not!&nbsp; Because so to die were to die unwillingly, and give them
triumph.&nbsp; Be dragged to death?&nbsp; No, old dog, if die we must,
we will go to death!&nbsp; We will die grandly, highly, as becomes Tavannes!&nbsp;
That when we are gone they may say, &lsquo;There died a man!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> may say!&rdquo; Bigot muttered, scowling.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal heard and glared at him, but presently thought better
of it, and after a pause&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, she too!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; As
we have played the game&mdash;for her&mdash;so, though we lose, we will
play it to the end; nor because we lose throw down the cards!&nbsp;
Besides, man, die in the corner, die biting, and he dies too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; Bigot asked, rising in a fury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not?&nbsp; Whose work is it we lie here, snared by these clowns of fisherfolk?&nbsp;
Who led us wrong and betrayed us?&nbsp; He die?&nbsp; Would the devil
had taken him a year ago!&nbsp; Would he were within my reach now!&nbsp;
I would kill him with my bare fingers!&nbsp; He die?&nbsp; And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because, fool, his death would not save me!&rdquo; Count
Hannibal answered coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it would, he would die!&nbsp;
But it will not; and we must even do again as we have done.&nbsp; I
have spared him&mdash;he&rsquo;s a white-livered hound!&mdash;both once
and twice, and we must go to the end with it since no better can be!&nbsp;
I have thought it out, and it must be.&nbsp; Only see you, old dog,
that I have the dagger hid in the splint where I can reach it.&nbsp;
And then, when the exchange has been made, and my lady has her silk
glove again&mdash;to put in her bosom!&rdquo;&mdash;with a grimace and
a sudden reddening of his harsh features&mdash;&ldquo;if master priest
come within reach of my arm, I&rsquo;ll send him before me, where I
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; said Badelon.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if you fail
of your stroke I will not fail of mine!&nbsp; I shall be there, and
I will see to it he goes!&nbsp; I shall be there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, why not?&rdquo; the old man answered quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
may halt on this leg for aught I know, and come to starve on crutches
like old Claude Boiteux who was at the taking of Milan and now begs
in the passage under the Ch&acirc;telet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah, man, you will get a new lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Badelon nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, a new lord with new ways!&rdquo;
he answered slowly and thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I am tired.&nbsp;
They are of another sort, lords now, than they were when I was young.&nbsp;
It was a word and a blow then.&nbsp; Now I am old, with most it is&mdash;&rsquo;Old
hog, your distance!&nbsp; You scent my lady!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they
rode, and hunted, and tilted year in and year out, and summer or winter
heard the lark sing.&nbsp; Now they are curled, and paint themselves,
and lie in silk and toy with ladies&mdash;who shamed to be seen at Court
or board when I was a boy&mdash;and love better to hear the mouse squeak
than the lark sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, if I give you my gold chain,&rdquo; Count Hannibal
answered quietly, &ldquo;&rsquo;twill keep you from that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to Bigot,&rdquo; the old man answered.&nbsp; The splint
he was fashioning had fallen on his knees, and his eyes were fixed on
the distance of his youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;For me, my lord, I am tired,
and I go with you.&nbsp; I go with you.&nbsp; It is a good death to
die biting before the strength be quite gone.&nbsp; Have the dagger
too, if you please, and I&rsquo;ll fit it within the splint right neatly.&nbsp;
But I shall be there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll strike home?&rdquo; Tavannes cried eagerly.&nbsp;
He raised himself on his elbow, a gleam of joy in his gloomy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, my lord.&nbsp; See, does it tremble?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He held out his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when you are sped, I will try
the Spanish stroke&mdash;upwards with a turn ere you withdraw, that
I learned from Ruiz&mdash;on the shaven pate.&nbsp; I see them about
me now!&rdquo; the old man continued, his face flushing, his form dilating.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be odd if I cannot snatch a sword and hew down three
to go with Tavannes!&nbsp; And Bigot, he will see my lord the Marshal
by-and-by; and as I do to the priest, the Marshal will do to Montsoreau.&nbsp;
Ho! ho!&nbsp; He will teach him the <i>coup de Jarnac</i>, never fear!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the old man&rsquo;s moustaches curled up ferociously.</p>
<p>Count Hannibal&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with joy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old dog!&rdquo;
he cried&mdash;and he held his hand to the veteran, who brushed it reverently
with his lips&mdash;&ldquo;we will go together then!&nbsp; Who touches
my brother, touches Tavannes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touches Tavannes!&rdquo; Badelon cried, the glow of battle
lighting his bloodshot eyes.&nbsp; He rose to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;Touches
Tavannes!&nbsp; You mind at Jarnac&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; At Jarnac!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we charged their horse, was my boot a foot from yours,
my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at Dreux,&rdquo; the old man continued with a proud, elated
gesture, &ldquo;when we rode down the German pikemen&mdash;they were
grass before us, leaves on the wind, thistledown&mdash;was it not I
who covered your bridle hand, and swerved not in the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was!&nbsp; It was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at St. Quentin, when we fled before the Spaniard&mdash;it
was his day, you remember, and cost us dear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, I was young then,&rdquo; Tavannes cried in turn, his eyes
glistening.&nbsp; &ldquo;St. Quentin!&nbsp; It was the tenth of August.&nbsp;
And you were new with me, and seized my rein&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we rode off together, my lord&mdash;of the last, of the
last, as God sees me!&nbsp; And striking as we went, so that they left
us for easier game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so, good sword!&nbsp; I remember it as if it had been
yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at Cerisoles, the Battle of the Plain, in the old Spanish
wars, that was most like a joust of all the pitched fields I ever saw&mdash;at
Cerisoles, where I caught your horse?&nbsp; You mind me?&nbsp; It was
in the shock when we broke Guasto&rsquo;s line&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Cerisoles?&rdquo; Count Hannibal muttered slowly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, man, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught your horse, and mounted you afresh?&nbsp; You remember,
my lord?&nbsp; And at Landriano, where Leyva turned the tables on us
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Landriano?&rdquo; he muttered
bluntly.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in &rsquo;29, forty years ago and
more!&nbsp; My father, indeed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at Rome&mdash;at Rome, my lord?&nbsp; <i>Mon Dieu</i>!
in the old days at Rome!&nbsp; When the Spanish company scaled the wall&mdash;Ruiz
was first, I next&mdash;was it not my foot you held?&nbsp; And was it
not I who dragged you up, while the devils of Swiss pressed us hard?&nbsp;
Ah, those were days, my lord!&nbsp; I was young then, and you, my lord,
young too, and handsome as the morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rave!&rdquo; Tavannes cried, finding his tongue at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rome?&nbsp; You rave, old man!&nbsp; Why, I was not born in those
days.&nbsp; My father even was a boy!&nbsp; It was in &rsquo;27 you
sacked it&mdash;five-and-forty years ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man passed his hands over his heated face, and, as a man
roused suddenly from sleep looks, he looked round the room.&nbsp; The
light died out of his eyes&mdash;as a light blown out in a room; his
form seemed to shrink, even while the others gazed at him, and he sat
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I remember,&rdquo; he muttered slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
was Prince Philibert of Chalons, my lord of Orange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead these forty years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, dead these forty years!&nbsp; All dead!&rdquo; the old
man whispered, gazing at his gnarled hand, and opening and shutting
it by turns.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I grow childish!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis time,
high time, I followed them!&nbsp; It trembles now; but have no fear,
my lord, this hand will not tremble then.&nbsp; All dead!&nbsp; Ay,
all dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank into a mournful silence; and Tavannes, after gazing at him
awhile in rough pity, fell to his own meditations, which were gloomy
enough.&nbsp; The day was beginning to wane, and with the downward turn,
though the sun still shone brightly through the southern windows, a
shadow seemed to fall across his thoughts.&nbsp; They no longer rioted
in a turmoil of defiance as in the forenoon.&nbsp; In its turn, sober
reflection marshalled the past before his eyes.&nbsp; The hopes of a
life, the ambitions of a life, moved in sombre procession, and things
done and things left undone, the sovereignty which Nostradamus had promised,
the faces of men he had spared and of men he had not spared&mdash;and
the face of one woman.</p>
<p>She would not now be his.&nbsp; He had played highly, and he would
lose highly, playing the game to the end, that to-morrow she might think
of him highly.&nbsp; Had she begun to think of him at all?&nbsp; In
the chamber of the inn at Angers he had fancied a change in her, an
awakening to life and warmth, a shadow of turning to him.&nbsp; It had
pleased him to think so, at any rate.&nbsp; It pleased him still to
imagine&mdash;of this he was more confident&mdash;that in the time to
come, when she was Tignonville&rsquo;s, she would think of him secretly
and kindly.&nbsp; She would remember him, and in her thoughts and in
her memory he would grow to the heroic, even as the man she had chosen
would shrink as she learned to know him.</p>
<p>It pleased him, that.&nbsp; It was almost all that was left to please
him&mdash;that, and to die proudly as he had lived.&nbsp; But as the
day wore on, and the room grew hot and close, and the pain in his thigh
became more grievous, the frame of his mind altered.&nbsp; A sombre
rage was born and grew in him, and a passion fierce and ill-suppressed.&nbsp;
To end thus, with nothing done, nothing accomplished of all his hopes
and ambitions!&nbsp; To die thus, crushed in a corner by a mean priest
and a rabble of spearmen, he who had seen Dreux and Jarnac, had defied
the King, and dared to turn the St. Bartholomew to his ends!&nbsp; To
die thus, and leave her to that puppet!&nbsp; Strong man as he was,
of a strength of will surpassed by few, it taxed him to the utmost to
lie and make no sign.&nbsp; Once, indeed, he raised himself on his elbow
with something between an oath and a snarl, and he seemed about to speak.&nbsp;
So that Bigot came hurriedly to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Water, fool!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, having drunk, he turned his face to the wall, lest he should name
her or ask for her.</p>
<p>For the desire to see her before he died, to look into her eyes,
to touch her hand once, only once, assailed his mind and all but whelmed
his will.&nbsp; She had been with him, he knew it, in the night; she
had left him only at daybreak.&nbsp; But then, in his state of collapse,
he had been hardly conscious of her presence.&nbsp; Now to ask for her
or to see her would stamp him coward, say what he might to her.&nbsp;
The proverb, that the King&rsquo;s face gives grace, applied to her;
and an overture on his side could mean but one thing, that he sought
her grace.&nbsp; And that he would not do though the cold waters of
death covered him more and more, and the coming of the end&mdash;in
that quiet chamber, while the September sun sank to the appointed place&mdash;awoke
wild longings and a wild rebellion in his breast.&nbsp; His thoughts
were very bitter, as he lay, his loneliness of the uttermost.&nbsp;
He turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p>In that posture he slept after a time, watched over by Bigot with
looks of rage and pity.&nbsp; And on the room fell a long silence.&nbsp;
The sun had lacked three hours of setting when he fell asleep.&nbsp;
When he re-opened his eyes, and, after lying for a few minutes between
sleep and waking, became conscious of his position, of the day, of the
things which had happened, and his helplessness&mdash;an awakening which
wrung from him an involuntary groan&mdash;the light in the room was
still strong, and even bright.&nbsp; He fancied for a moment that he
had merely dozed off and awaked again; and he continued to lie with
his face to the wall, courting a return of slumber.</p>
<p>But sleep did not come, and little by little, as he lay listening
and thinking and growing more restless, he got the fancy that he was
alone.&nbsp; The light fell brightly on the wall to which his face was
turned; how could that be if Bigot&rsquo;s broad shoulders still blocked
the loophole? Presently, to assure himself, he called the man by name.</p>
<p>He got no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badelon!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Badelon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he gone, too, the old and faithful?&nbsp; It seemed so, for again
no answer came.</p>
<p>He had been accustomed all his life to instant service; to see the
act follow the word ere the word ceased to sound.&nbsp; And nothing
which had gone before, nothing which he had suffered since his defeat
at Angers, had brought him to feel his impotence and his position&mdash;and
that the end of his power was indeed come&mdash;as sharply as this.&nbsp;
The blood rushed to his head; almost the tears to eyes which had not
shed them since boyhood, and would not shed them now, weak as he was!&nbsp;
He rose on his elbow and looked with a full heart; it was as he had
fancied.&nbsp; Badelon&rsquo;s stool was empty; the embrasure&mdash;that
was empty too.&nbsp; Through its narrow outlet he had a tiny view of
the shore and the low rocky hill, of which the summit shone warm in
the last rays of the setting sun.</p>
<p>The setting sun!&nbsp; Ay, for the lower part of the hill was growing
cold; the shore at its foot was grey.&nbsp; Then he had slept long,
and the time was come.&nbsp; He drew a deep breath and listened.&nbsp;
But on all within and without lay silence, a silence marked, rather
than broken, by the dull fall of a wave on the causeway.&nbsp; The day
had been calm, but with the sunset a light breeze was rising.</p>
<p>He set his teeth hard, and continued to listen.&nbsp; An hour before
sunset was the time they had named for the exchange.&nbsp; What did
it mean?&nbsp; In five minutes the sun would be below the horizon; already
the zone of warmth on the hillside was moving and retreating upwards.&nbsp;
And Bigot and old Badelon?&nbsp; Why had they left him while he slept?&nbsp;
An hour before sunset!&nbsp; Why, the room was growing grey, grey and
dark in the corners, and&mdash;what was that?</p>
<p>He started, so violently that he jarred his leg, and the pain wrung
a groan from him.&nbsp; At the foot of the bed, overlooked until then,
a woman lay prone on the floor, her face resting on her outstretched
arms.&nbsp; She lay without motion, her head and her clasped hands towards
the loophole, her thick, clubbed hair hiding her neck.&nbsp; A woman!&nbsp;
Count Hannibal stared, and, fancying he dreamed, closed his eyes, then
looked again.&nbsp; It was no phantasm.&nbsp; It was the Countess; it
was his wife!</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath, but he did not speak, though the colour rose
slowly to his cheek.&nbsp; And slowly his eyes devoured her from head
to foot, from the hands lying white in the light below the window to
the shod feet; unchecked he took his fill of that which he had so much
desired&mdash;the seeing her!&nbsp; A woman prone, with all of her hidden
but her hands: a hundred acquainted with her would not have known her.&nbsp;
But he knew her, and would have known her from a hundred, nay from a
thousand, by her hands alone.</p>
<p>What was she doing here, and in this guise?&nbsp; He pondered; then
he looked from her for an instant, and saw that while he had gazed at
her the sun had set, the light had passed from the top of the hill;
the world without and the room within were growing cold.&nbsp; Was that
the cause she no longer lay quiet?&nbsp; He saw a shudder run through
her, and a second; then it seemed to him&mdash;or was he going mad?&mdash;that
she moaned, and prayed in half-heard words, and, wrestling with herself,
beat her forehead on her arms, and then was still again, as still as
death.&nbsp; By the time the paroxysm had passed, the last flush of
sunset had faded from the sky, and the hills were growing dark.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.&nbsp; HIS KINGDOM.</h2>
<p>Count Hannibal could not have said why he did not speak to her at
once.&nbsp; Warned by an instinct vague and ill-understood, he remained
silent, his eyes riveted on her, until she rose from the floor.&nbsp;
A moment later she met his gaze, and he looked to see her start.&nbsp;
Instead, she stood quiet and thoughtful, regarding him with a kind of
sad solemnity, as if she saw not him only, but the dead; while first
one tremor and then a second shook her frame.</p>
<p>At length &ldquo;It is over!&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience,
Monsieur; have no fear, I will be brave.&nbsp; But I must give a little
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To him!&rdquo; Count Hannibal muttered, his face extraordinarily,
pale.</p>
<p>She smiled with an odd passionateness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was my lover!&rdquo;
she cried, her voice a-thrill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who will ever be my lover,
though I have denied him, though I have left him to die!&nbsp; It was
just.&nbsp; He who has so tried me knows it was just!&nbsp; He whom
I have sacrificed&mdash;he knows it too, now!&nbsp; But it is hard to
be&mdash;just,&rdquo; with a quavering smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;You who take
all may give him a little, may pardon me a little, may have&mdash;patience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Hannibal uttered a strangled cry, between a moan and a roar.&nbsp;
A moment he beat the coverlid with his hands in impotence.&nbsp; Then
he sank back on the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water!&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fetched it hurriedly, and, raising his head on her arm, held
it to his lips.&nbsp; He drank, and lay back again with closed eyes.&nbsp;
He lay so still and so long that she thought that he had fainted; but
after a pause he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done that?&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;you have done
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, shuddering.&nbsp; &ldquo;God forgive
me!&nbsp; I have done that!&nbsp; I had to do that, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it too late&mdash;to undo it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; A sob choked her voice.</p>
<p>Tears&mdash;tears incredible, unnatural&mdash;welled from under Count
Hannibal&rsquo;s closed eyelids, and rolled sluggishly down his harsh
cheek to the edge of his beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have gone,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
had spoken, I would have spared you this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she answered unsteadily; &ldquo;the men told
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just.&nbsp; And you are my husband,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;More, I am the captive of your sword, and as you spared me in
your strength, my lord, I spared you in your weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu!&nbsp; Mon Dieu, Madame!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;at
what a cost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that arrested, that touched her in the depths of her grief and
her horror; even while the gibbet on the causeway, which had burned
itself into her eyeballs, hung before her.&nbsp; For she knew that it
was the cost to <i>her</i> he was counting.&nbsp; She knew that for
himself he had ever held life cheap, that he could have seen Tignonville
suffer without a qualm.&nbsp; And the thoughtfulness for her, the value
he placed on a thing&mdash;even on a rival&rsquo;s life&mdash;because
its was dear to her, touched her home, moved her as few things could
have moved her at that moment.&nbsp; She saw it of a piece with all
that had gone before, with all that had passed between them, since that
fatal Sunday in Paris.&nbsp; But she made no sign.&nbsp; More than she
had said she would not say; words of love, even of reconciliation, had
no place on her lips while he whom she had sacrificed awaited his burial.</p>
<p>And meantime the man beside her lay and found it incredible.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was just,&rdquo; she had said.&nbsp; And he knew it; Tignonville&rsquo;s
folly&mdash;that and that only had led them into the snare and caused
his own capture.&nbsp; But what had justice to do with the things of
this world?&nbsp; In his experience, the strong hand&mdash;that was
justice, in France; and possession&mdash;that was law.&nbsp; By the
strong hand he had taken her, and by the strong hand she might have
freed herself.</p>
<p>And she had not.&nbsp; There was the incredible thing.&nbsp; She
had chosen instead to do justice!&nbsp; It passed belief.&nbsp; Opening
his eyes on a silence which had lasted some minutes, a silence rendered
more solemn by the lapping water without, Tavannes saw her kneeling
in the dusk of the chamber, her head bowed over his couch, her face
hidden in her hands.&nbsp; He knew that she prayed, and feebly he deemed
the whole a dream.&nbsp; No scene akin to it had had place in his life;
and, weakened and in pain, he prayed that the vision might last for
ever, that he might never awake.</p>
<p>But by-and-by, wrestling with the dread thought of what she had done,
and the horror which would return upon her by fits and spasms, she flung
out a hand, and it fell on him.&nbsp; He started, and the movement,
jarring the broken limb, wrung from him a cry of pain.&nbsp; She looked
up and was going to speak, when a scuffling of feet under the gateway
arch, and a confused sound of several voices raised at once, arrested
the words on her lips.&nbsp; She rose to her feet and listened.&nbsp;
Dimly he could see her face through the dusk.&nbsp; Her eyes were on
the door, and she breathed quickly.</p>
<p>A moment or two passed in this way, and then from the hurly-burly
in the gateway the footsteps of two men&mdash;one limped&mdash;detached
themselves and came nearer and nearer.&nbsp; They stopped without.&nbsp;
A gleam of light shone under the door, and some one knocked.</p>
<p>She went to the door, and, withdrawing the bar, stepped quickly back
to the bedside, where for an instant the light borne by those who entered
blinded her.&nbsp; Then, above the lanthorn, the faces of La Tribe and
Bigot broke upon her, and their shining eyes told her that they bore
good news.&nbsp; It was well, for the men seemed tongue-tied.&nbsp;
The minister&rsquo;s fluency was gone; he was very pale, and it was
Bigot who in the end spoke for both.&nbsp; He stepped forward, and,
kneeling, kissed her cold hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have gained all, and lost
nothing.&nbsp; Blessed be God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed be God!&rdquo; the minister wept.&nbsp; And from the
passage without came the sound of laughter and weeping and many voices,
with a flutter of lights and flying skirts, and women&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>She stared at him wildly, doubtfully, her hand at her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he is not dead&mdash;M. de Tignonville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is alive,&rdquo; La Tribe answered, &ldquo;he is alive.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he lifted up his hands as if he gave thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alive!&nbsp; Oh, Heaven
is merciful.&nbsp; You are sure?&nbsp; You are sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Madame, sure.&nbsp; He was not in their hands.&nbsp;
He was dismounted in the first shock, it seems, and, coming to himself
after a time, crept away and reached St. Gilles, and came hither in
a boat.&nbsp; But the enemy learned that he had not entered with us,
and of this the priest wove his snare.&nbsp; Blessed be God, who put
it into your heart to escape it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Countess stood motionless, and with closed eyes pressed her hands
to her temples.&nbsp; Once she swayed as if she would fall her length,
and Bigot sprang forward to support and save her.&nbsp; But she opened
her eyes at that, sighed very deeply, and seemed to recover herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo; she said faintly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
no trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Madame, it is no trick,&rdquo; La Tribe answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;M. de Tignonville is alive, and here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo;&nbsp; She started at the word.&nbsp; The colour
fluttered in her cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the keys,&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp;
And she passed her hand across her brow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought&mdash;that
I had them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not entered,&rdquo; the minister answered, &ldquo;for
that reason.&nbsp; He is waiting at the postern, where he landed.&nbsp;
He came, hoping to be of use to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused a moment, and when she spoke again her aspect had undergone
a subtle change.&nbsp; Her head was high, a flush had risen to her cheeks,
her eyes were bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, addressing La Tribe, &ldquo;do you,
Monsieur, go to him, and pray him in my name to retire to St. Gilles,
if he can do so without peril.&nbsp; He has no place here&mdash;now;
and if he can go safely to his home it will be well that he do so.&nbsp;
Add, if you please, that Madame de Tavannes thanks him for his offer
of aid, but in her husband&rsquo;s house she needs no other protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bigot&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with joy.</p>
<p>The minister hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;No more, Madame?&rdquo; he faltered.&nbsp;
He was tender-hearted, and Tignonville was of his people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; she said gravely, bowing her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not M. de Tignonville I have to thank, but Heaven&rsquo;s mercy,
that I do not stand here at this moment unhappy as I entered&mdash;a
woman accursed, to be pointed at while I live.&nbsp; And the dead&rdquo;&mdash;she
pointed solemnly through the dark casement to the shore&mdash;&ldquo;the
dead lie there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Tribe went.</p>
<p>She stood a moment in thought, and then took the keys from the rough
stone window-ledge on which she had laid them when she entered.&nbsp;
As the cold iron touched her fingers she shuddered.&nbsp; The contact
awoke again the horror and misery in which she had groped, a lost thing,
when she last felt that chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them,&rdquo; she said; and she gave them to Bigot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Until my lord can leave his couch they will remain in your charge,
and you will answer for all to him.&nbsp; Go, now, take the light; and
in half an hour send Madame Carlat to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave broke heavily on the causeway and ran down seething to the
sea; and another and another, filling the room with rhythmical thunders.&nbsp;
But the voice of the sea was no longer the same in the darkness, where
the Countess knelt in silence beside the bed&mdash;knelt, her head bowed
on her clasped hands, as she had knelt before, but with a mind how different,
with what different thoughts!&nbsp; Count Hannibal could see her head
but dimly, for the light shed upwards by the spume of the sea fell only
on the rafters.&nbsp; But he knew she was there, and he would fain,
for his heart was full, have laid his hand on her hair.</p>
<p>And yet he would not.&nbsp; He would not, out of pride.&nbsp; Instead
he bit on his harsh beard, and lay looking upward to the rafters, waiting
what would come.&nbsp; He who had held her at his will now lay at hers,
and waited.&nbsp; He who had spared her life at a price now took his
own a gift at her hands, and bore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Afterwards, Madame de Tavannes</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind went back by some chance to those words&mdash;the words
he had neither meant nor fulfilled.&nbsp; It passed from them to the
marriage and the blow; to the scene in the meadow beside the river;
to the last ride between La Fl&egrave;che and Angers&mdash;the ride
during which he had played with her fears and hugged himself on the
figure he would make on the morrow.&nbsp; The figure?&nbsp; Alas! of
all his plans for dazzling her had come&mdash;<i>this</i>!&nbsp; Angers
had defeated him, a priest had worsted him.&nbsp; In place of releasing
Tignonville after the fashion of Bayard and the Paladins, and in the
teeth of snarling thousands, he had come near to releasing him after
another fashion and at his own expense.&nbsp; Instead of dazzling her
by his mastery and winning her by his magnanimity, he lay here, owing
her his life, and so weak, so broken, that the tears of childhood welled
up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness a hand, cool and firm, slid into his, clasped
it tightly, drew it to warm lips, carried it to a woman&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I was the captive of
your sword, and you spared me.&nbsp; Him I loved you took and spared
him too&mdash;not once or twice.&nbsp; Angers, also, and my people you
would have saved for my sake.&nbsp; And you thought I could do this!&nbsp;
Oh! shame, shame!&rdquo;&nbsp; But her hand held his always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved him,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I loved him,&rdquo; she answered slowly and thoughtfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I loved him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she fell silent a minute.&nbsp;
Then, &ldquo;And I feared you,&rdquo; she added, her voice low.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, how I feared you&mdash;and hated you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not fear him,&rdquo; she answered, smiling in the darkness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nor hate him.&nbsp; And for you, my lord, I am your wife and
must do your bidding, whether I will or no.&nbsp; I have no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that not so?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He tried weakly to withdraw his hand.</p>
<p>But she clung to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must bear your blows or your
kisses.&nbsp; I must be as you will and do as you will, and go happy
or sad, lonely or with you, as you will!&nbsp; As you will, my lord!&nbsp;
For I am your chattel, your property, your own.&nbsp; Have you not told
me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your heart,&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;is his!&nbsp;
Your heart, which you told me in the meadow could never be mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lied,&rdquo; she murmured, laughing tearfully, and her hands
hovered over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has come back!&nbsp; And it is on
my lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she leant over and kissed him.&nbsp; And Count Hannibal knew
that he had entered into his kingdom, the sovereignty of a woman&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>An hour later there was a stir in the village on the mainland.&nbsp;
Lanthorns began to flit to and fro.&nbsp; Sulkily men were saddling
and preparing for the road.&nbsp; It was far to Challans, farther to
L&egrave;ge&mdash;more than one day, and many a weary league to Ponts
de C&eacute; and the Loire.&nbsp; The men who had ridden gaily southwards
on the scent of spoil and revenge turned their backs on the castle with
many a sullen oath and word.&nbsp; They burned a hovel or two, and stripped
such as they spared, after the fashion of the day; and it had gone ill
with the peasant woman who fell into their hands.&nbsp; Fortunately,
under cover of the previous night every soul had escaped from the village,
some to sea, and the rest to take shelter among the sand-dunes; and
as the troopers rode up the path from the beach, and through the green
valley, where their horses shied from the bodies of the men they had
slain, there was not an eye to see them go.</p>
<p>Or to mark the man who rode last, the man of the white face&mdash;scarred
on the temple&mdash;and the burning eyes, who paused on the brow of
the hill, and, before he passed beyond, cursed with quivering lips the
foe who had escaped him.&nbsp; The words were lost, as soon as spoken,
in the murmur of the sea on the causeway; the sea, fit emblem of the
Eternal, which rolled its tide regardless of blessing or cursing, good
or ill will, nor spared one jot of ebb or flow because a puny creature
had spoken to the night.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
